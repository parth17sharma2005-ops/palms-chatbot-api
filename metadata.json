The dawn of supply chain technologys next phase has arrived, marking a departure from stand-alone systems with limited functions. The future of warehouse operations now revolves around a cohesive blend of technology and strategic alliances, prioritizing customer-centric approaches. Its evident that adhering to traditional fulfillment practices no longer suffices for many product-based enterprises. The conventional model of warehouse management, reliant on timelines set days or weeks ahead, falls short in todays era of tightened delivery schedules. In this landscape, streamlining processes from order entry to shipment dispatch has become imperative, presenting a challenge for most businesses. The repercussions of failing to address fundamental issues such as inventory availability were starkly evident during the pandemic. Retailers, for instance, suffered a significant loss of 7.4 in sales in 2021 due to out-of-stock items, amounting to a staggering 82 billion. Furthermore, inventory-related errors, including overstocking, purchasing incorrect products, or mismanaging inventory allocation, contributed to approximately 53 of unplanned markdown expenses. To address inefficiencies, organizations require more than just a standard Warehouse Management System (WMS). They necessitate a technology-driven strategy that integrates diverse systems, enhancing efficiency and meeting evolving requirements. This approach stimulates innovation, advocates for sustainable practices, and cultivates adaptable resilience within the ecosystem. One avenue to accomplish this is through broader implementation of warehouse automation, which can elevate optimization to unprecedented levels by reducing labor requirements, enhancing inventory and fulfillment accuracy, and amplifying warehouse efficiency. However, to effectively harness warehouse automation, systems must possess adequate flexibility to adjust to changing dynamics effectively.

    "text": "E-book Home EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT INVENTORY FORECASTING Accurate inventory forecasting is essential for every supply chain business, especially when customer demand changes rapidly. Mathematical and statistical data analysis is central to this process. To put it in technical terms, inventory forecasting or demand planning refers to the practice of using data on past events and trends to predict inventory amounts needed to meet future demand. When forecasting is accurate, businesses are prepared with enough product to fulfill orders and inventory spending is not too much or too little. Effective inventory forecasting can make all the difference in profitability. For example, accurate inventory forecasting can provide strategic insights that a company can use to align the levels of inventory with their business goals. It leads to more reliable data, improved reporting, and ultimately better margins and profitability. Production cycles and supply chains can be handled better with inventory forecasting, since it allows for the automation of other inventory processes. The risk of stockouts is also significantly reduced through inventory forecasting. The bottomline impact of accurate inventory forecasting is clear ordering is much more precise, stock is maintained at a realistic threshold, and less money is tied up in inventory.

    "text": "PALMS - Integrations Home In the dynamic ecosystem of PALMS Smart WMS integrated with an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, a plethora of vital information is exchanged seamlessly. Augmenting operational efficiency with the shared data, internal processes are further optimized and ultimately the customer experience is smoother. The data sync from PALMS to ERP ensures that your ERP tool has all the up-to-date information on inventory levels and movement within the warehouse. PALMS is a warehouse management software used by large enterprises worldwide. Without a direct integration with ERP, updating sales and customer data alongside the inventory data becomes a time-consuming and cumbersome task. This can lead to incongruencies, for example, the online store may continue taking orders for items that are out of stock. The flow of information The ERP and WMS maintain a continuous exchange of information, and their roles evolve based on data types and processes, resembling the well-known masterslave IT model. This establishes a data stream in both directions The ERP system is responsible for creating and managing master databases, releasing new products, adding suppliers, sending purchase orders, and generating invoices. In these tasks, the ERP exercises control over the WMS. Conversely, the WMS transfers information to the ERP when goods arrive at the warehouse or orders are dispatched, acting as the master for updating inventory data. Stringent control of this data exchange is crucial to prevent errors and duplication. This control is typically implemented through assigning various statuses (pending, processing, prepared, loaded, dispatched, etc.), guiding both systems on permissible actions based on defined rules. For instance, the WMS is restricted from loading orders not marked as invoiced by the ERP. Options for connecting PALMS Smart WMS with the ERP On a technical level, there are various ways to carry out the data exchange between the ERP and WMS. Lets look at the various ways PALMS achieves this integration Staging table method Staging tables are intermediary tables specifically designed to hold the extracted data temporarily. These tables act as a buffer zone, allowing data to be transformed and validated before being sent to the ERP system. The ERP system periodically retrieves data from the staging tables. Integration tools or scripts are employed to map the data from the staging tables to the corresponding tables or modules in the ERP system. Flat File Transfer (CSV) Method Data extracted from the WMS is transformed into a format that is suitable for flat file representation, often CSV format. Data may be restructured, reformatted, or modified to match the requirements of the ERP system. The CSV files are transferred from the WMS system to the ERP system. This transfer can occur through various means, such as file transfer protocols (FTP), secure file transfer protocols (SFTP), or other designated communication channels. Web Services Method In this case, the exchange of information between the ERP and WMS is done through a web interface, so both systems need to have internet access to be able to operate with it. This means that the software programs call a database in the cloud via HTTP protocol. The database then returns the information in XML format, which is subsequently incorporated into the system. What the integration means for your business Order Tracking and Shipment Visibility Transparency is key in the modern business landscape. The integration allows customers to track their orders effortlessly. From order placement to shipment and delivery, real-time updates are made available, providing customers with a heightened sense of control over their purchases.

    "text": "Case Study FMCG Campaigns Home About the client The client handles the promotional material warehouses for one the leading FMCG brands in India for over past 15 years. The operations spans across all states with 30 warehouse with mother warehouse located in Mumbai using hub and spoke model. Problem Statement Client has 30 warehouses across India that handles the products of 50 lines of business of the said FMCG brand in hub and spoke model. As the Client handles promotional materials, the product code changes every month in line with the latest promotions. To meet this requirement, the client wanted a system that could easily create SKU codes every month. Due to bulk of material movement in hub and spoke model, the tracking of products in all the warehouses and transfer from mother warehouse to child warehouse created huge operational issues. Identifying lossesdamages of product during transfers was a major problem with cost implications. Tracking and linking of kits and components during kitting and de-kitting operations with the supplier invoices was required, even after the material were transferred to other warehouses. Similarly, tracking of material against purchase order number in all warehouse was tedious task. Solution PALMS has multi-warehouse and multi-company support and user access control based on the same parameters. This provides operational control and visibility of stock on warehouse level for each line of business. The client specific solutions to create monthly operational cycle and creating new SKU codes using bulk upload for each operational cycle was implemented. External stock transfers were configured for movement of stock from mother warehouse to child warehouse and tracking of movement within and across both warehouses. Any dispatched materials from mother warehouse gets an auto ASN created in child warehouse to track any losses during the transportation. Damages are also handled at the time of receiving in the child warehouses. Option to create kits within the warehouse and workflow of kit creation was implemented. This feature keeps the trace of components during the kitting and de-kitting operations. PO management module helped in easing out of tracking the purchase orders in all warehouse. The client has been using PALMS since past 4 years as an all-around WMS solution for all their warehouses operations.",

    "text": "Case Study Distribution Industries Home About the client One of the foremost distribution companies in the UAE, which offers top quality products that span different market segments like Food, Toys and Sports. Along with distribution, the client also provides concepts and solutions for Retailers across Category management and merchandising. Problem Statement As a distributor dealing with multiple segments, the client wanted a WMS which could cater to segregation of products at various levels. They required the WMS to ensure that certain products are restricted to certain zones, for example Foods to be restricted to temperature-controlled zones. Apart from location management, the system had to take care of location suggestion and handling of periodic inventory reconciliation. They required the WMS to seamlessly integrate with their existing ERP. As they deal with Food, its primary requirement was to manage expiry information and ensure that earliest expiry stock is shipped out first. Solution PALMS helped the clients to configure different rules for different categories of items so that specific product could be stored in specific areas of the warehouse. This included soft reservation rules as well as restrictions (hard rules) which could not be violated. The system also offered a host of configurations to make location management easy and suggest locations during put-away. The guided put-awaypicking option available in the HHT application of PALMS, helped improve the overall operational productivity during both put-away and picking process. Built in inventory reconciliation options like stock count and cycle count helped the client automate their inventory reconciliation process. Options like blind count, reconciliation instruction based on stock movements (Last moved SKUs or locations) helped maintain accurate inventory levels. Stock discrepancies post inventory reconciliation was automatically calculated by PALMS and interfaced to clients ERP. The intelligent allocation engine offered by PALMS ensured that the earliest expiry items were the first to ship out, thereby reducing inventory loss. PALMS also offered a built-in framework for seamlessly integrating with external systems on a real time basis, there by eliminating the need to manually maintain data in two different systems. This ensured inventory positions across both the systems were accurate. PALMS has been successful in assisting the client with all their operational issues since past 5 years.",

    "text": "Case Study Ceramics and Tiles industries Home About the client One of the leading manufacturers of the ceramics brand, the client has multiple categories like tiles, sanitaryware and many more. Product portfolio for the client includes Vitrified Tiles, Bathroom Tiles, Kitchen Tiles, Fullbody Tiles, Outdoor Tiles, Wall Tiles and Sanitaryware. Problem Statement Clients requirement was to manage inventory and operations in the warehouse attached to each of the three production units located in Gujarat. Apart from the production warehouses, Client also required the WMS to handle operations at the warehouse located in Maharashtra. Thus, the two warehouse locations needed to have different processes configured within the solution. Discrepancy of gradequality was found in SAP and Physical Stock at the time of manual production entry. One of their main concerns was lack of visibility of inventory in the warehouses. Apart from visibility of overall inventory in the warehouses, they were not able to track inventory levels for a specific gradequality and batch combination. This is a crucial aspect in ceramics industry as only one grade and batch combination for an SKU should be sent to the customer to avoid variations in tiles. Solution PALMS supports multi-warehouse operations and has feature to implement different workflows for different processes. The two processes implemented were Receiving of finished goods directly from production line to Gujarat warehouses and receiving of finished goods in Maharashtra warehouse from Gujarat. PALMS gave visibility regarding stock levels in all four warehouses. Palletization using Handy PALMS enabled the user to palletize same item batch grade combinations in a pallet. This made tracking and picking of pallet efficient. PALMS provides an option to allocate materials based on batch attributes specified in a customer order to dispatch the requested batch-grade combination of SKU. PALMS was integrated with SAP to maintain accurate stock levels in both systems. A flow was developed specifically for Client for correcting any discrepancies in grade of tiles and sending updated information to SAP. Additionally, PALMS was integrated with Transport Management System at Maharashtra warehouse for vehicle planning. Client has been successfully running warehouse operations on PALMS since past 3 years.",

PALMS has been associated with CP since its inception and has helped CP onboarding and managing operations of global brands like Nivea and Total Energies. CentrePoint Supply Chain Solutions Ltd (CP) is a wholly owned Ghanaian based contract logistics company. Started with a Warehouse in Tema, CP is expanding to other parts of West Africa. PALMS has been associated with CP since its inception and has helped CP onboarding and managing operations of global brands like Nivea and Total Energies. Problem Statement CentrePoint is a 3PL Operator looking for a scalable WMS which could optimize Warehouse space for maximizing profits. They also had a requirement that software solution should have the capability to communicate with multiple client ERPs using varied integration formats (like Idoc, csv, XMLs etc).

Solution PALMS helped CP team configure different workflows for material coming from different suppliers. PALMS provides a built-in framework through which any ERP system can be integrated. The framework also provided the option to choose different integration format types (like idoc, xml, Rest APIs, csv) for data transfer. In case of CP, PALMS seamlessly integrated with Beiersdorfs ERP system, SAP, using Idoc as the integration format. PALMS Intelligent Location Suggestion algorithm helped them optimize Warehouse Location utilization. Android based HHT for Warehouse Operations resulted in accurate inventory and increased operator throughput by using concepts like Guided Putaway and Guided Picking. PALMS provided options to create Inventory Reconciliation Instructions based on either Locations or SKUs. Among other options, option to generate Inventory Reconciliation Instruction based on the stock movement for a defined period like days, weeks, months etc. was given. Using this option, CP was able to generate Inventory Reconciliation Instruction for the LocationsSKUs where movement was observed the previous day. Any discrepancies in stock after physical verification could be adjusted automatically in PALMS and interfaced to the clients ERP. This ensured physical stock and the book stock always matched. Stock Compare Report was also provided to CP for tallying Stock positions at the end of the day.

    "text": "Light Systems Home PALMS Light Systems PALMS Put-to-Light and PALMS Pick-to-Light Systems are seamlessly integrated with PALMS Smart Warehouse Management System. PALMS Put-to-Light Systems Put-to-light solutions utilize a series of LED light devices to provide guidance to operators regarding where to place goods and the quantity to pack into each package, box, or shelf drawer. The primary objective of put-to-light is to efficiently organize products in shipping boxes, ensuring a swift and error-free process. The put-to-light system can be deployed on picking shelves or carts to facilitate efficient pick-to-cart operations. Heres how it functions each container is equipped with a corresponding light. During order preparation, the display at the relevant location illuminates, indicating to the operator where to deposit the goods and the required quantity. Put-to-light systems are integrated with the PALMS Smart Warehouse Management System (WMS), which manages the light displays and automates decision-making for operators. In essence, the WMS instructs operators on which box to place the goods in and displays the quantity on the LED screen for the specific SKU. The software is also connected to the RF scanners that operators use to scan the products for sorting. Put-to-light systems are commonly implemented to minimize errors in batch picking, where operators pack varying quantities of a single SKU into multiple orders. To expedite the supply of goods to pick stations where orders are sorted, a conveyor system for boxes can be established to ensure a continuous flow of stock alongside the put-to-light system. PALMS Pick-to-Light Systems Pick to light represents a category of order fulfillment technology aimed at enhancing picking precision and efficiency, while simultaneously reducing labor expenses. Importantly, pick to light operates in a paperless manner by utilizing alphanumeric displays and buttons situated at storage locations to assist your workforce in manual picking, placement, sorting, and assembly tasks. The typical operation of Pick-to-Light Systems is as follows Operators scan item barcodes affixed to temporary and reusable storage containers, such as shipping cartons. Subsequently, the systems alphanumeric display, often comprising LED lights, illuminates to indicate a pathway guiding the operator to the designated storage area. There, the system specifies both the quantity and the specific items to be picked. The operator retrieves the item(s), deposits them into the storage container, and confirms the picking action by pressing a button. This process continues iteratively, with each sector being illuminated for picking until all items have been successfully picked and placed within their respective storage containers. Depending on the specific pick-to-light system, additional functionalities may be available. Frequently, apart from the LED display, pick to light includes an acknowledgment button and a digital readout to facilitate more detailed instructions and options. For instance, your chosen system might permit employees to record fundamental data like variations in pick sizes, while other systems might provide specific instructions, order numbers, zone directions, and supplementary information.

    "text": "Agriculture and Cold Storage Management Software Home PALMS - Agriculture and Cold Storage Management System Cold storage system is a warehouse management program that can be applied to help regulate conditions like temperature and humidity levels in warehouses that preserve perishable items like vegetables, fruits, and meat, or products that require special conditions, like pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, plants and textiles. The management of cold storage warehouses is a complicated process that involves innumerable variables. A good cold store software has a multitude of capabilities that can manage tasks like inbound and outbound logistics, supplier, agent and customer details, payments, and inventory management. These functions are simplified when the right software is employed for records, automation and analytics saving time and cutting down on errors. How does a cold store benefit from WMS? With cold storage requiring temperatures as low as 28C, saving on energy costs and maximizing capacity of the warehouse are major concerns. Mobile racking and drive-in racking are typical strategies used by cold storage warehouses to utilize space as efficiently as possible. However, operational issues can arise out of such strategies and thats where the WMS comes in. There are many similar warehousing challenges specific to cold storage management that can be addressed with our top-of-the-shelf WMS. Labeling The mechanism that connects the product to the WMS are the barcodes. Any inaccuracy in this labeling be it expiry dates, specific types or location tags can be catastrophic. The precision of PALMS with the printing and location labeling technology ensures that such scenarios are avoided.

Historical data is analysed to forecast demand and optimize the use of assets and warehouse capacity. This data-driven approach empowers warehouse professionals to make proactive decisions, shifting from a reactive mode of operation. As a result, resource allocation, inventory control, and overall efficiency are dramatically improved. Automation and Robotics Automation and robotics represent a cornerstone of modern warehousing, and PALMS seamlessly integrates these technologies. Automation reduces labor costs and enhances precision by handling routine tasks with minimal human intervention. Concurrently, robotics accelerates order fulfillment and inventory management. These advancements minimize human error and increase the overall efficiency of warehouse operations. Technology for Enhanced Transparency In addition to the existing features, PALMS embraces technology to offer enhanced transparency and trust within the warehouse. PALMS decentralized ledger records all transactions and movements securely. It brings transparency, streamlines supply chain communication through smart contracts, ensures enhanced security, and offers end-to-end traceability. With reduced paperwork and improved accuracy, PALMS adds a new layer of confidence and efficiency to the modern warehouse. PALMS - A Future-Ready WMS Implementing a Warehouse Management System is one of the most critical decisions for any enterprise with supply-chain-intensive operations. Once implemented, the WMS becomes a backbone for all future warehouse operations across the enterprise. One key decision-making factor is the WMSs readiness for future requirements. While current requirements may be limited, it cannot be ruled out that requirements will evolve and more complexity will be added to the business operations. PALMS Smart WMS is a highly scalable solution with a rich set of Add-On Modules that can be opted for at any later date, whenever the need arises Wave Picking eCommerce operations are increasingly becoming a part of large enterprise supply chains. PALMS Wave Picking module is designed especially for eCommerce-related picking operations, offering the capabilities for automated wave generation based on pre-set criteria. It achieves this by batching orders together for consolidated pick operations. These picks are then quickly sorted into orders, packed as per destination, and slotted as per the couriershipping partner. The coexistence of eCommerce and conventional warehouse operations is becoming commonplace in warehouse operations. PALMS also offers the capability to manage omni-channel warehouse operations using multiple configurable workflow templates within the same warehouse. PALMS VMT The PALMS Android-based HHT App is optimized for Vehicle Mounted Terminals with long-range scanners. This ensures fast scanning by MHE operators without having to leave their seats each time. It improves the productivity of MHE Operators threefold by reducing travel time. For managers, Handy PALMS increases accessibility and mobility in the warehouse by offering remote visualization capabilities. PALMS Resource Cost Tracking PALMS allows accurate tracking of manpower, machinery, and consumable resources.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) ready interfaces Most time data that has to be entered into the system is not available in digitized EDI CSV formats. Users are forced to perform repetitive data entry tasks in such scenarios. For example, ASN details wherein Supplier Invoices are sent as hard copies or PDF files. RPA interfaces in PALMS use tools like UIPath to process various types of Supplier Invoices so that all data entry can be done by the RPA robots. This eliminates needless manual labor and activities that contribute to the wastage of time and resources. PALMS Activity Planner The PALMS Activity Planner and Scheduler is driven by operations research-based heuristics and artificial intelligence.

The application is divided into multiple layers to enhance the scalability, testability and performance of the application. The different layers are Presentation Layer UI The presentation layer is implemented through Google Web Toolkit (GWT), that provides a rich user experience and true browser independence Business Logic Layer The business logic layer comprises of two parts Core Product Business Logic layer The core product business logic refers to the fundamental set of rules, processes, and procedures that define the essential functions and features of PALMS . It is the underlying logic that drives PALMS and provides its unique value proposition to customers Customizable Business Logic Layer This layer can be used to define custom set of rules, processes and procedures unique to a business client. Using this layer, clientspartners can customize the underlying logic of PALMS to suit the business requirements Application Programming Interface (API) The API layer provides various options to integrate PALMS with external surrounding systems. The inbuilt integration options provided by PALMS are Rest API based integration XML based integration CSV (Flat File) based integration Data Access Layer (DAL) The DAL implementation in PALMS provides APIs for accessing, insertion, updation and deletion of data. Workflows Workflow implementation in PALMS consists of Built-In Workflows The built-in workflows reflect the standard processes followed by the warehousing industry. These workflows ensure that the implementation of PALMS at the client warehouse are fast and smooth. Customized Workflows Although the built-in workflows take care of majority of scenarios, we understand that some customers require tailor made workflows to manage their operations. The custom workflow engine of PALMS allows clientspartners to customize the stock and cost workflows according to the business requirements. Similar to the above-mentioned layers, the mobile application of PALMS is also divided into multiple layers. They are Mobile Presentation LayerUI The presentation layer of HandyPALMS is implemented through Xamarin Mobile Specific Business Logic The mobile specific business logic layer consists of the rules, procedures and processes that govern the working of HandyPALMS. The PALMS warehouse architecture also provides for enhanced built-in security features. They are Single Sign On (SSO) PALMS can be integrated with the Active Directory (AD) or with a Centralized Identity Provider, to securely sign in to PALMS and authenticate without having to specify the login credentials. On receipt of successful authorization token, the user is automatically logged in to the application with appropriate access rights. SSO integration increases the user experience and also reduces the overall administrative overhead as organizations can control access to multiple applications through a common user id. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA is a security process that combines two different forms of validation to authenticate the user trying to access PALMS. The MFA implementation in PALMS consists of The password associated with the user id One Time Password (OTP) generated and shared to the users email and phone number. The use of MFA ensures that the application and data remain safe as anyone looking to gain illegal access to the system will have to compromise multiple layers of authentication rather than just a password.

According to McKinsey Company , warehouses that leverage AI-powered tools can unlock an additional 715 of warehouse capacity. These technologies integrate with warehouse management systems (WMS) and automation to streamline tasks and cut operational costs. They also support fully automated dark warehouse operations, where AI and robotics handle tasks around the clock. In this blog, we will look into how AI and ML help with demand forecasting, efficiency and more in warehouses. What is a Dark Warehouse? What is a Dark Warehouse A dark warehouse is essentially a fully automated facility designed to operate with little to no human presence. In these environments, robotics and advanced automation systems take over the core functions of warehousingreceiving, storage, picking and shipping. Goods may be stored in automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) grids, picked by robotic arms and transported by autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). Behind the scenes, a warehouse management system (WMS) orchestrates operations, dynamically adjusting stock placement, dispatching robots and ensuring workflows run smoothly. How a Dark Warehouse Operates In a typical dark warehouse, incoming goods are unloaded and sorted by conveyors or robotic arms before being placed into storage bins. Autonomous shuttles transport these bins to and from vertical rack systems, creating dense and efficient storage. When an order is placed, the WMS immediately dispatches robots to retrieve the items and deliver them to automated packing stations. Every step is coordinated by software powered by real-time data. Since these facilities run 247 without breaks or shift changes, they can process a far higher volume of orders than human-operated warehouses. Dark warehouses combine the power of AI, robotics and intelligent WMS to deliver unmatched efficiency, scalability and cost savings. By removing many of the constraints of human-dependent operations, they represent the next frontier in logistics and supply chain management. Key Applications of AI and ML in Dark Warehouses Key Applications of AI and ML in Dark Warehouses Artificial intelligence is no longer just a futuristic concept, its already transforming how warehouses operate on a daily basis. Here are some of the most impactful applications Demand Forecasting Machine learning models analyze sales trends, seasonality and other factors to predict product demand. Accurate forecasts let warehouses keep the right inventory on hand and reduce excess stock. Inventory Management AI-powered WMS can automate replenishment and re-slotting. For example, systems may move fast-selling items to accessible racks and reorder stock when levels drop, cutting carrying costs. Order-Picking Optimization AI optimizes picking routes using real-time order data and warehouse layouts. By clustering commonly ordered items and adjusting slotting, AI reduces travel distance, shortening cycle times and cutting errors. Predictive Maintenance IoT sensors feed equipment data into ML models to forecast failures. AI-driven maintenance scheduling prevents breakdowns and unplanned downtime, extending machinery life. Role of WMS and IoT in Dark Warehouses A warehouse management system (WMS) functions as the central brain that connects people, machines and data. By integrating with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors, RFID tags and automated equipment, a modern WMS can continuously capture real-time information about inventory movement, equipment status and order progress. Artificial intelligence enhances this process by analyzing the incoming data and turning it into actionable decisions. For instance, the WMS might automatically re-slot fast-moving items closer to packing stations to reduce travel time or direct autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to balance workloads",

The result is a warehouse that doesnt just store goods, but actively drives efficiency through data-driven operations and smart automation. Benefits of AI in Dark Warehousing Benefits of AI in Dark Warehousing The integration of AI, machine learning and automation is redefining warehouse performance. Here are some of the key benefits Labor Savings Repetitive tasks such as picking and sorting can now be handled by robots and intelligent software. This reduces dependency on manual labor, easing hiring pressures in a sector often challenged by workforce shortages. As a result, companies can lower staffing costs while allowing human workers to focus on more strategic tasks. Higher Productivity AI-driven systems operate around the clock, ensuring steady, 247 output. For example, AI tools can unlock additional warehouse capacity by optimizing labor and equipment usage. Inventory Efficiency Smarter forecasting and AI-powered inventory controls help warehouses maintain the right stock levels. By better predicting demand and dynamically adjusting inventory, businesses can reduce carrying costs and avoid both overstocking and stockouts. McKinsey estimates that AI can cut inventory levels by 2030, directly boosting profitability. Energy and Resource Efficiency Dark warehouses are designed to minimize waste and resource use. AI can automatically dim lights or adjust temperatures in unused zones, while automation enables denser storage layouts that save valuable space. Equipment can also power down when idle, resulting in lower utility bills. Error Reduction Automated processes guided by AI and robotics significantly reduce human error. Machine vision and precise robotic systems improve picking accuracy, ensuring that inventory data remains up to date. Dark warehouses, in particular, maintain exceptionally accurate records without relying on frequent manual recounts. Flexibility and Scalability AI and automation make warehouses more agile in responding to demand spikes. During seasonal peaks, businesses can scale quickly by adding a few more robots or extending automated shiftswithout the delays associated with hiring and training temporary staff. This adaptability ensures smooth operations even during high-volume periods. Together, these benefits translate into faster fulfillment, lower operating costs and stronger customer satisfaction. Challenges and Considerations Challenges and Considerations While AI-driven automation and dark warehouses promise significant efficiency gains, they also introduce challenges that companies must carefully navigate. Below are some of the key hurdles and practical solutions to overcome them. High Capital Investment Implementing a dark warehouse requires a substantial upfront investment. Robots, sensors, IoT devices and AI-powered software come with steep price tags and the costs dont end there. Designing, testing and integrating these systems into an existing supply chain requires specialized expertise and often custom solutions. For many businesses, particularly small and mid-sized players, this level of investment can pose a significant barrier to adoption. Solution Companies can mitigate costs by adopting a phased implementation strategy. They can start with partial automation in high-impact areas (e.g., order picking or replenishment) before scaling to full automation. Complexity of System Integration Building a fully automated warehouse is not as simple as purchasing robots.

They can start with partial automation in high-impact areas (e.g., order picking or replenishment) before scaling to full automation. Complexity of System Integration Building a fully automated warehouse is not as simple as purchasing robots. Dark facilities rely on the seamless interaction between hardware, software and data systems. Any misalignment, whether in WMS, IoT sensors, or robotic workflows, can create bottlenecks or system failures. Also, warehouses must prepare for exceptions, such as irregularly shaped goods, returns, or damaged items. If these scenarios are not preprogrammed into the system, operations may come to a halt. Solution Conduct extensive simulation and testing before deployment, using digital twins to model warehouse operations and identify bottlenecks. In addition, designing a hybrid approach where human workers handle edge cases while automation manages standardized processes, ensures resilience when exceptions occur. Limited Flexibility with Certain Goods Dark warehouses excel at handling standardized, high-volume products, but they are less suited for delicate, customized, or irregular items. For example, fragile goods that require careful handling or items that do not fit into automated bins may require manual intervention. This limitation makes dark warehousing more practical for industries with predictable product types, such as e-commerce, retail and consumer goods, rather than sectors with high product variability. Solution Adopt a hybrid warehouse strategy where dark warehouse zones manage high-volume SKUs, while separate manual or semi-automated areas handle sensitive or unusual products. Cybersecurity Risks As warehouses become more connected, they also become more vulnerable to digital threats. Every IoT device, cloud platform and software integration creates a potential entry point for hackers. A breach could compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, or even halt fulfillment entirely. Solution Implement multi-layered cybersecurity protocols, including end-to-end encryption, regular system audits and intrusion detection systems. Workforce Impact Automation inevitably reshapes the workforce. While robots take over repetitive, low-skill tasks, this can reduce the need for traditional warehouse labor. Solution Rather than eliminating staff, companies can reskill employees into higher-value roles such as robotics maintenance, system supervision and data analysis. Offering structured training programs and clear career pathways helps workers embrace automation as an opportunity rather than a threat.

    "text": "For businesses nowadays, minimizing delays across the supply chain is a necessity for success. Lead time is the total time taken from order initiation to final delivery. It plays a pivotal role in determining operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. It encompasses every step in the supply chain process order placement, procurement of raw materials, manufacturing or assembly and finally, shipping and delivery. According to studies , reducing lead time by just one day can increase machine operating hours by 814, significantly boosting productivity. A shorter lead time means faster delivery, streamlined operations and happier customers. On the other hand, long lead times can disrupt production schedules, inflate holding costs and erode customer trust. In this blog, we will look into the importance of lead time and why its important for businesses. Why Lead Time Matters The market today is customer-driven, which means lead times are more than a logistical advantagetheyre a competitive necessity. Quick turnaround times help businesses meet rising customer expectations for fast delivery, which in turn boosts satisfaction, loyalty and ultimately, sales. Operationally, reducing lead time also leads to significant cost savings. It lowers the need for excess inventory, cuts down on carrying costs and frees up valuable cash flow. According to Anvyl , companies with shorter lead times can respond more quickly to shifts in demand, avoid overstocking and improve overall supply chain agility. On the flip side, long lead times can create serious challenges. They often result in delayed deliveries, customer dissatisfaction, excess safety stock, higher storage costs and even lost sales due to stockouts. Therefore, businesses that fail to manage lead time effectively risk falling behind. Types of Lead Time Types of Lead Time Lead time varies depending on the specific stage of the process, right from raw material procurement to product delivery. Understanding the different types of lead time helps businesses identify delays, streamline operations and improve overall efficiency. Customer Lead Time This refers to the total time a customer waits, from placing an order to receiving the final product. It represents the complete end-to-end delivery timeline from the customers perspective and is a critical factor in customer satisfaction. Material (Procurement) Lead Time Also known as supplier lead time, this is the time taken to source raw materials or components from a supplier. It begins when a purchase order is placed and ends when the materials arrive at the warehouse. Efficient procurement lead time is vital for maintaining inventory levels and avoiding production delays. Production (Manufacturing) Lead Time This is the time required to transform raw materials into finished goods. It starts when production begins and ends when the product is fully assembled and ready for shipment. Shorter production lead times can significantly increase responsiveness to market demand. Order Processing Lead Time This covers the internal operations between receiving an order and preparing it for shipment. It includes tasks like picking, packing and labeling but excludes actual delivery time. Optimizing this lead time is key to faster fulfillment. Transportation (Delivery) Lead Time Once an order is packed and ready, this lead time measures the duration it takes to deliver the product to the final destination. Factors like shipping method, distance and logistics efficiency impact this timeline. Cumulative Lead Time This is the total lead time across the entire supply chain, from ordering raw materials to delivering the final product to the customer. It includes procurement, production, assembly, order processing and transportation. Cumulative lead time is essential for planning and forecasting, as it helps ensure that all parts and processes are aligned to meet demand on time.

It includes procurement, production, assembly, order processing and transportation. Cumulative lead time is essential for planning and forecasting, as it helps ensure that all parts and processes are aligned to meet demand on time. Calculating Lead Time Calculating Lead Time Lead time is typically divided into three key components pre-processing, processing and post-processing. While the terminology may vary across industries, the general formula remains the same. Lead time can be calculated by summing the durations of its stages. A general formula is Lead Time Pre-Processing Time Processing Time Post-Processing Time In a manufacturing context Pre-processing time refers to the procurement phase, where raw materials are sourced and delivered to the manufacturing facility. Processing time is the actual production or manufacturing phase. Post-processing time involves order handling and delivering the finished goods to the customer. This basic formula is widely applicable, whether in manufacturing, software development, or supply chain management. However, in more complex operations, the lead time formula can be expanded to account for multiple stages of the process. For example LT Manufacturing Time Procurement Time Shipping Time This is often used by manufacturers managing end-to-end production. LT Procurement Time Shipping Time This is common for retailers sourcing finished goods. These variations follow a simple principle break down the entire process into individual steps and add their durations together to determine the total lead time. Factors Affecting Lead Time Factors Affecting Lead Time Lead time in a supply chain is influenced by a range of interconnected factors. Even small disruptions at any stage can lead to significant delays. Understanding these influences is key to optimizing processes and ensuring timely order fulfillment. Lets break down the most common contributors Supplier and Procurement Delays If a supplier is slow to confirm or deliver materials due to negotiation, paperwork, limited capacity, etc., lead time rises. Raw-material shortages or choosing the wrong vendor can stall orders. Inventory Management Poor control, such as stockouts or excess stock, also disrupts flow. When inventory isnt available to fulfill an order, production halts until replenishment arrives. Good inventory systems, including safety stock and reorder points, are essential to prevent unexpected delays. Production Bottlenecks Inefficient factory layouts, equipment breakdowns, insufficient labor, or extra quality inspections all lengthen manufacturing time. Delays in one stage cascade through the schedule. Logistics and Shipping Issues Slow transport methods, weather, customs, or routing problems can add days to delivery. For instance, choosing a cheaper but slower shipping option or encountering port delays will extend lead time. External Disruptions Events beyond control, such as natural disasters, strikes, pandemics, sudden demand spikes and government regulations, often increase lead time unpredictably. There should be robust risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans in place to handle unexpected spikes in lead time. Strategies to Shorten Lead Time Reducing lead time is not just about speeding up delivery, its about making your entire supply chain more responsive, efficient and cost-effective. Here are some key strategies supply chain teams use to shorten lead time and boost performance Just-In-Time Inventory Implement JIT to carry minimal stock and rely on frequent replenishment.

Strong Supplier Relationships Work with dependable vendors and maintain clear communication. Choose suppliers who consistently deliver on schedule and share your demand forecasts. For example, building strong relationships with reliable suppliers ensures they can meet tight schedules. Additionally, having multiple suppliers also provides backup if one fails. Efficient Production Scheduling Efficient production planning helps eliminate delays on the shop floor. Tools like value-stream mapping and lean manufacturing principles can uncover bottlenecks, reduce idle time and streamline workflows. Additionally, reducing unnecessary steps and wait times in manufacturing shortens production lead time. Technology and Automation Use ERP or planning software for real-time visibility. Automated order-entry and inventory tracking eliminate manual errors and delays. Modern systems can track stock and supplier performance, allowing planners to accurately predict lead times and schedule production in advance. For example, tools that estimate supplier lead times from historical data and monitor inventory levels help avoid surprises. Communication and Collaboration Miscommunication across departments or with suppliers can cause avoidable delays. Sharing key performance indicators (KPIs), dashboards and forecasts across procurement, production and logistics teams ensures everyone is on the same page. Regular check-ins and collaborative platforms help identify and resolve issues quickly. Optimize Order Policies Switching from large, infrequent orders to smaller, more frequent ones can help materials move more steadily through the supply chain. This improves inventory turnover and reduces wait times. Additionally, sourcing from local or regional suppliers shortens transit times and minimizes customs-related delays. Continuous Improvement Lead time optimization isnt a one-time fixit requires ongoing monitoring and process refinement. Use metrics and automated reports to identify inefficiencies, track performance over time and adjust workflows accordingly. Cross-training employees, standardizing procedures and eliminating non-value-added steps can create lasting gains.

    "text": "Customer-centric warehousing means shifting the focus of logistics from just storing goods to meeting customer needs. Todays shoppers expect speed, accuracy, and transparency. Warehouses are no longer just back-end storage spacestheyve become vital touchpoints in the customer journey. By positioning inventory closer to buyers, accelerating order fulfillment, and streamlining returns, logistics teams directly enhance customer satisfaction. According to EV Cargo , shortening delivery distances not only reduces carbon emissions but also improves overall efficiency. These improvements benefit more than just customers they also help businesses cut waste and lower operational costs. Warehouses play a key role in the retail experience. Delays or order errors can quickly lead to customer frustration, while automation and smart workflows help ensure every package is accurate and delivered on time. Simply put, the better a warehouse meets customer expectations, the stronger a brands reputation and loyalty becomes. In this blog, well look into how customer centric warehousing provides a better logistics experience for both consumers and businesses. What Is Customer-Centric Warehousing? What Is Customer-Centric Warehousing Customer-centric warehousing is an approach where the entire warehousing operation is designed to serve the needs and expectations of the end customer. Traditional warehousing mainly focuses on minimizing costs and maximizing storage space. However, customer-centric models prioritize speed, accuracy, and transparent communication. For example, instead of one huge central warehouse, a company might use several smaller warehouses located near big customer markets. This approach brings products closer to the end user, shortening delivery times. Key features of a customer-focused warehouse include Strategic location Placing warehouses near major customer bases so orders travel shorter distances. Fast restocking Quickly replenishing popular items so that products dont sell out. Zara , for instance, can restock trending items in real time to match customer demand. Transparent tracking Giving customers updates on their orders at every step. Modern warehouses integrate their systems, so buyers can track packages or get delivery alerts. Easy returns Handling product returns smoothly. As about 30 of online orders are returned , many warehouses now include dedicated returns centers to process refunds and restock items quickly. Benefits of Putting Customers First in Warehousing Setups Benefits of Putting Customers First in Warehousing Setups Adopting a customer-centric approach for warehousing pays off in multiple ways. Lets look into them. Faster Delivery Times Locating warehouses closer to customers shortens shipping routes, often enabling same-day or two-day delivery. For example, Amazons fulfillment network supports its popular two-day delivery promise for most orders. Meeting these faster delivery expectations not only enhances customer satisfaction but can also justify premium shipping charges. Higher Order Accuracy Automation and smart warehouse systems help reduce picking and packing errors. Manual handling introduces more opportunities for mistakes, while automation increases customer satisfaction. Technologies like barcode scanning , voice-picking , and robotics ensure that the correct items are selected and shipped, leading to fewer complaints and returns. Better Inventory Availability Data-driven inventory management ensures products are restocked before they run out. By analyzing trends and real-time demand, warehouses can anticipate what needs replenishing. Walmart, for example, uses big data models to forecast inventory levels and keep popular items available. This minimizes the frustrating sold out experience for customers and helps prevent lost sales. Improved Sustainability Warehouses located near areas of high demand help reduce transportation distances. This approach reduces the distance of goods travel, leading to lower carbon emissions. Environmentally conscious customers appreciate these efforts, which can improve a brands public image.

Some companies are going even further by investing in solar-powered facilities and energy-efficient operations. Reduced Costs and Waste Customer-centric warehousing doesnt just enhance the customer experience it also helps reduce costs. Strategies like consolidating shipments into full containers lead to better utilization of transport capacity. Reduced travel distances and fewer errors also bring down operational expenses. Additionally, streamlined returns processing recovers more value from returned products, minimizing financial losses Key Components of Customer-Centric Warehousing Key Components of Customer-Centric Warehousing Building a customer-focused warehouse involves several strategic practices. Lets look into the various components necessary. Multi-Node Distribution Instead of relying on a single central hub, companies are increasingly using multiple regional warehouses to bring inventory closer to their customers. This decentralized approach shortens delivery times and increases fulfillment efficiency. Optimizing a warehouse network is critical for fast and efficient order fulfillment. Strategically located distribution centers mean products spend less time in transit and customers get their orders faster. Automation and Robotics Automation boosts both speed and accuracy. Technologies like automated storage, retrieval systems, and conveyor-based sorters eliminate manual bottlenecks. Additionally, robotic arms and high-speed packing machines also streamline the fulfillment process, reducing errors and handling time. Overall, automation ensures that every order is picked, packed, and shipped accurately. Real-Time Inventory Management Modern Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and IoT devices provide precise, real-time control over inventory. Tools like RFID tags and barcode scanners automatically update stock levels as items are received, moved, or shipped. This constant visibility allows warehouse managers and even customers to know exactly what is in stock at any moment. Real-time insights prevent stockouts and ensure accurate order fulfillment, reducing customer frustration and lost sales. Data-Driven Planning Warehousing decisions are increasingly guided by data. By analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and regional demand patterns, companies can better forecast demand and optimize inventory levels. Walmarts predictive stocking strategy is one example of using big data to stay ahead of demand. Amazon takes it a step further with patented anticipatory packaging shipping algorithms that position high-demand products near customers before theyre even ordered. The insight is clear, the more a warehouse knows about what customers will need, the faster it can fulfill orders. Flexible Capacity Demand isnt static it changes by season, week, and even time of day. To stay agile, warehouses are adopting flexible solutions like on-demand space rentals and elastic staffing. For instance, renting pallet space temporarily or hiring seasonal workers helps meet peak demand without long-term overhead. These flexible operations allow businesses to adapt quickly to shifting conditions. Whether its a holiday surge or a sudden slowdown, flexibility ensures consistent service levels. Seamless Returns Handling With online return rates for products being around 30, efficient returns processing is essential. Many retailers now operate dedicated return centers designed to handle high volumes quickly and effectively. These facilities are structured to manage inspections, repackaging, restocking, or routing to liquidation zones.

    "text": "The warehouse dispatch process traces all outbound operations from the warehouse. This article looks at how the warehouse dispatch process is carried out in PALMS Smart WMS. Warehouse Inbound Process Flow A robust warehouse inbound process flow is essential for enhancing your businesss productivity. Depending on the specific challenges faced by your warehouse, you might need to hire additional staff. The inbound process flow should encompass the following steps Schedule All Deliveries Avoid leaving delivery timing to chance, as this can lead to a crowded delivery area and delays in unloading pallets. Implement an automated scheduling system for delivery drivers or plan delivery days and times in advance. Designate an Unloading Area Often overlooked, the unloading area is crucial in your inbound process flow. This space is dedicated to breaking down cases and transporting products to shelves. Implement Inventory Management Simply shelving products is not enough an inventory management process characterized by precision and speed is necessary. If products require special handling or storage conditions, these should be included in your process flow. Additionally, any specific storage needs, such as warehouse labels, should be part of the inbound flow. Update Your Reports Your inbound process flow should include thorough documentation of products entering the warehouse and their subsequent storage locations. Whether managed manually or through an automated system, it is essential to have written records of all processed work. Warehouse Dispatch Process and Outbound Flow Grasping the warehouse dispatch process flow in your warehouse is vital for the success of your organization. This process is key to meeting the expectations of both distribution service providers and customers. At a minimum, the warehouse dispatch process flow should involve the following steps Establish a Packing Area Ensure your warehouses packing area operates smoothly. Packing stations should be equipped with SKU numbers, barcode scanners, label printers, packing materials, and computers for processing orders. Always keep these stations well-stocked with e-commerce packaging to avoid delays. Set Up a Shipping Staging Area This area is where completed packages are prepared for loading onto trucks. Efficient organization allows drivers to start loading packages immediately upon arrival. Track Shipping and Delivery Notifications Utilize your warehouse management system (WMS) to monitor which products have been shipped and which are pending. Some WMSs also offer notifications when customers receive their orders, reducing the need for follow-up communication about packages. If there are issues with a package, contact your carrier for further information. Maintain Accurate Records Your warehouse dispatch process flow should include detailed documentation of the products leaving your warehouse and their destinations. Whether managed manually by staff or through an automated system, it is essential to have written records of all completed work. Video Outbound Operations and the Warehouse Dispatch Process The Warehouse Dispatch Process An In-Depth Guide Efficient warehouse operations are essential for maintaining a seamless supply chain. The warehouse dispatch process involves sales order processing, stock allocation, picking, sorting, packing, loading, invoicing, and dispatching, ensuring that products are delivered accurately and on time. Here, we outline each step in detail, highlighting the integration of technology and best practices to optimize these operations. Sales Order Processing The warehouse dispatch process begins with the creation of a sales order, which can be generated through multiple modes Screen Entry Manually inputting orders via a user interface. CSVExcel Upload Importing orders in bulk through CSV or Excel files. Integration Automatically creating orders through integration with other systems, such as ERP or e-commerce platforms.

CSVExcel Upload Importing orders in bulk through CSV or Excel files. Integration Automatically creating orders through integration with other systems, such as ERP or e-commerce platforms. This flexibility ensures that sales orders are captured efficiently, catering to different business needs. Stock Allocation Once a sales order is created, stock allocation can be done based on predefined SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) rules FIFO (First In, First Out) Allocates the oldest stock first. FEFO (First Expired, First Out) Prioritizes items nearing their expiration date. FMFO (First Manufactured, First Out) Uses the manufacturing date to determine allocation. Location Flush Clears stock from specific locations. Combination Rules A mix of the above rules to optimize allocation. The system ensures that stock is allocated optimally across different units of measurement (UOMs), maintaining accuracy and efficiency. Picking Instruction Creation Based on the estimated time of arrival (ETA) in the sales order and the lead time for subsequent processes like picking, packing, loading, and dispatch, the system automatically generates picking instructions. These instructions are then assigned to a picking operator. In scenarios where the same team handles both putaway and picking, task interleaving is employed to opportunistically assign tasks, enhancing operational efficiency. The system selects an appropriate picking methodology based on order type and SKU characteristics Wave Picking For batch processing of multiple orders. Route-based Picking Optimized for delivery routes. Bulk Picking For large quantity items. Zone Picking Dividing the warehouse into zones. Order Wise Picking Specific to individual orders. Picking The picking task is automatically assigned to an operator, who receives a notification. An automated guidance algorithm helps identify and guide the operator on the optimal picking path. The operator executes the picking instruction by scanning barcodes, QR codes, or using voice picking instructions. Picked items are then moved to one of the following locations based on operational needs Sorting Area Packing Area Dispatch Area Sorting Operation The system employs a guided sorting operation to sort SKUs belonging to different orders. This can be achieved through HHT-based Sorting Using Hand Held Terminals. Sort-to-Light Using light indicators to sort SKUs order-wise. Packing Operation Packing is executed using HHT or screen operations. SKUs are packed into primary and secondary packaging and then further into transport packs. This step ensures that products are protected and consolidated for shipping. Preparing for Dispatch The system identifies the best freight forwarder for the shipment based on serviceability, volumetric weight-based pricing, fixed charges, and delivery lead time. It integrates with the freight forwarders portal to generate Air Waybill (AWB) numbers and print packing labels along with the packing list. Labels can be affixed manually or via a label applicator. Loading Packed SKUs are then loaded into the delivery vehicle, ready for dispatch. Invoicing At this stage, the system generates the tax invoice, which can be done within the system or by integrating with government portals to produce e-Invoices or e-WayBills. The invoice, along with the e-WayBill and packing list, is printed automatically. Dispatch When the vehicle reaches the security gate, a license plate reader automatically identifies the vehicle and retrieves its details in the system. The security personnel verify these details against physical documents, record important checklist parameters, and complete the vehicle-out process, generating a gate-out pass. An automatic email notification is sent to the customer, updating them on the delivery status. Proof of Delivery (POD)",

    "text": "The warehouse receiving process and putaway refers to all the processes that happen after the docking and unloading of a vehicle, including making a record of the goods and storing them away in all the racks and shelves of the warehouse. To establish a methodical approach to taking inbound inventory in the warehouse receiving process, scanning it for the WMS system, and placing it in its designated location in the most efficient manner while consuming the least amount of time, we have a fixed approach to the warehouse receiving and putaway process. Video The Warehouse Receiving and Putaway Process The Warehouse Receiving Process The warehouse receiving process holds significant importance for a business, serving the dual purpose of meeting consumer demand with fulfillment and ensuring smooth operational flow by keeping necessary stocks available. Warehouse receiving procedures need a thorough financial recording of inventory for accurate accounting and payment processes. This involves a protocol to meticulously document each incoming shipment, including tasks such as Assessing the quality of received goods Verifying the condition of acquired items Validating the quantity of inventory received Allocating appropriate storage space within the warehouse Generating paperwork in alignment with the incoming shipments Even the most minor deviations in any of these warehouse receiving processes can result in the company bearing the cost of any lost, damaged, or stolen items, directly impacting overall profitability. To prevent such occurrences, businesses need to implement a technologically advanced and automated warehouse management system that optimizes both receiving and putaway procedures. Yard management with a WMS can help simplify warehouse receiving. To ensure a highly efficient warehouse receiving process with minimal margin for error, its crucial to follow the outlined cycle Unloading the shipment Warehouse receiving commences as soon as the shipment is unloaded from the transportation onto the warehouse unloading docks, and the following steps facilitate smooth handling of the items Verification of shipment quantity Generation of an Invoice Receipt Note (IRN) Placement of goods in the Bulk area for verification Signing the receipt of logistics to authorize transport release Conducting a detailed inspection of goods through a Goods Receipt Note (GRN) Confirm the receipt Following the creation of the IRN and GRN, the subsequent step is to thoroughly verify all particulars of the received goods. Its imperative to ensure that the delivered items align with the specifications outlined in the purchase order, including details ranging from descriptions to quantities of each item. Incorporate the following aspects into your checklist Product codes Description of the shipment Cargo weight Condition of received orders Identification of damages or missing items Should any disparities arise between the purchase order and the records of the consignment, promptly raise a query to mitigate potential issues with the suppliers. Create Unique Barcodes Following the verification process is the task of integrating the goods from warehouse receiving into the inventory. This involves either generating distinct barcodes for the consignment or inputting existing barcodes into the system. Depending on the nature of the shipment, items are categorized as follows Item Level Each item receives a unique SKU, applicable to products like mobile phones, televisions, etc. SKU Level A group of items is assigned the same SKU, suitable for products like bottles, cutlery, etc. None Level A single SKU is allocated to the entire shipment, appropriate for products like pens, food items, etc. These SKUs are then organized to facilitate efficient storage and monitoring. Additionally, for each SKU, shortage-debit notes and excess notes are generated, and supplementary GRN columns and manufacturer batch codes are uploaded as needed. The data within these notes may include information on manufacturing and expiry",

Additionally, for each SKU, shortage-debit notes and excess notes are generated, and supplementary GRN columns and manufacturer batch codes are uploaded as needed. The data within these notes may include information on manufacturing and expiry dates, factory numbers, belt numbers, etc. Conduct Quality Inspections Following the allocation of unique identifications to each shipment for streamlined recognition, the subsequent step involves conducting meticulous quality control assessments, distinguishing the received items as either acceptable or defective inventory. The QC process entails Conducting random inspections on each shipment Assessing the quality, size, and condition of items Categorizing inventory as acceptable or defective Allocating shelves for acceptable inventory (as part of the putaway process, elaborated further in the article) Initiating Return to Vendor (RTV) procedures for defective inventory Both acceptable and defective inventory must be documented, and relevant information needs to be communicated to suppliers and the payroll department to finalize the receiving process. Issue Payment Details Upon thorough examination of the received items, a payment receipt is generated and forwarded to the respective accounting teams, who then undertake the following steps to ensure accurate disbursements Comparing the payment receipt post-QC with the invoice received for the shipment In cases of discrepancies, the final payable amount corresponds to the acceptable inventory received Initiation of payments and recording of the final invoice for future reference. The Putaway Process in the Warehouse Once the receiving process is completed and payments are settled, the next phase involves organizing the received good inventory within the warehouse through putaway operations. Putaway, as its name suggests, involves assigning optimal storage locations within the warehouse for goods received from various vendors. This aims to enhance warehouse operations, expedite picking and packing processes, facilitate smoother deliveries, and ultimately improve overall customer satisfaction. Implementing an effective putaway process offers several benefits for your business Streamlined storage of goods Enhanced product safety Accurate documentation of inventory Improved space utilization Simplified access to products Reduced time spent locating items An efficient warehouse management system facilitates the attainment of these objectives by offering efficient putaway procedures. Putaway and shelf assignment are determined by factors such as order rotation, dimensions, weight, fragility, categorization, and other properties of each product, as well as the layout of the warehouse. A putaway list is generated, and a worker is tasked with executing the process. This involves scanning SKU barcodes on the list and designating locations for each item based on factors like demand, picking and packing time, size, and shelf life. Warehouse Putaway Methods Direct Putaway This approach involves scanning the SKUs on pallets and directly placing them into storage. Although its speedy, it lacks flexibility for processing orders received after goods are received and doesnt facilitate the separation of sales items from non-sales products. Managing direct putaway can become increasingly complex with a growing number of products. Dynamic Putaway This method leverages warehouse operation data to dynamically adjust inventory placement. By collecting information on product movements, such as pick time and inventory aging, the system can recommend optimized inventory placement and putaway strategies that evolve with changing data. Fixed Putaway In contrast to dynamic putaway, this method involves placing inventory in predetermined locations based on specific criteria (product type, destination, etc.), which remains unchanged",

Fixed Putaway In contrast to dynamic putaway, this method involves placing inventory in predetermined locations based on specific criteria (product type, destination, etc.), which remains unchanged over time. Additional factors to consider are By Customer (Applicable to Third-Party Logistics Warehouses) You have the option to allocate specific sections of your warehouse to customers utilizing your third-party logistics (3PL) services. This simplifies staff operations and is particularly effective for customers with fewer SKUs. By Storage Requirements Certain products may necessitate specialized storage conditions, such as refrigeration, requiring placement in designated areas. Alternatively, heavy items that shouldnt be stacked may need to be positioned closer to the necessary equipment for handling. By Volume Goods with high turnover rates, typically determined through ABC analysis, should be stored in areas that minimize travel distance to staging and packing zones. Regular monitoring will help anticipate when changes in sales volume require adjustments to your putaway procedures. In anticipation of seasonal spikes in shipping frequency (common in e-commerce), consider preemptively modifying your storage locations and putaway protocols. Tips to Optimize Your Putaway Process Warehouse Receiving and Automation Streamline the putaway and picking procedures through automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS), comprising a network of computer-controlled equipment. Additionally, leverage directed putaway functionalities provided by various warehouse management system (WMS) software platforms, which guide warehouse staff through the putaway process based on predefined rules for specific inventory. Optimizing the process flow Consider organizing heavier items in closer proximity to each other compared to lighter ones. This arrangement ensures that when an employee picks up an empty box (which should always be positioned adjacent to its full counterpart), they wont need to traverse as far across their workspace to find another empty box. This approach minimizes time wasted walking back from other areas of the warehouse where such boxes might belong. Warehouse Receiving Checklists Upon the completion of the warehouse receiving process, consider implementing the following procedures to effectively manage the warehouse receiving and putaway operations Does your warehouse track dock-to-stock time? Is your warehouse management system utilizing automation to recommend or direct inventory placement? Are pallet racks, floor locations, and replenishment areas appropriately labeled and barcoded? Are items stored according to the type of order fulfillment, such as pick units in bins, cases on racks, or pallets in overstock areas? Are items clearly barcoded with either Pallet License Plates or retail-ready UPC codes? Has your warehouse receiving transitioned to a paperless process or a WMS for complete scan-based item validation and putaway? Does your warehouse receiving team have real-time access to receiving status? By adhering to these warehouse receiving protocols before and after arrival, warehouses can enhance efficiency, provide better customer visibility, and capture automated activities to streamline the billing process for third-party logistics providers. How can you enhance the efficiency of the warehouse putaway procedure? Begin by assessing the nature of the inventory stocked in your warehouse. If there is a significant quantity of bulky items, it may be prudent to explore options for additional storage space. Similarly, for large, heavy, or specialized items requiring specific handling equipment, its crucial to ensure that your warehouse layout is tailored to accommodate their unique handling",

The Warehouse Receiving Process and Putaway with PALMS Smart WMS After vehicle docking, the shipment is prepared for unloading and warehouse receiving. In case the vehicle is waiting in parking lot, PALMS can help notify the driver through A message on his phone A notification on a board in the parking lot or drivers waiting area Or an announcement through a public address system. After docking, the supervisor scans the vehicle to record dock-in time in the WMS. The unloading team can scan the material before unloading if required. Barcode labels in the form of linear codes or QR codes can be printed at this stage and applied to the material. After unloading, an automatic receiving instruction is created by PALMS and assigned to the warehouse receiving team. A notification is shown on the HHT of the warehouse receiving team that a new task has been assigned. Items are received in PALMS using HHT. They can be received in a variety of formats Receive as-is (loose) Receive as-is (pallets) Receive as loose and put away as loose Receive as loose and put away as pallets (with or without additional VAS activities such as shrink wrapping) Receive as pallets and put away as loose After receiving, the putaway task is generated automatically, and the notification is displayed to the putaway team. An automated guidance algorithm is employed by the system to decide which bin, which SKU, and what quantity can be placed. The location suggestion algorithm considers the following points among others to decide the bin Reservations and Restrictions ABC value of the SKU SKUpallet dimensions Weight of the SKUpallet PALMS Smart WMS automatically suggests different locations for the pallets and the loose SKUs. The system guides the putaway team to put away the SKUs in the designated locations by calculating the optimal putaway path using pre-set algorithms.

    "text": "After receiving a notification about an item being out of stock, most consumers may simply choose to visit a competitors website instead. Some retailers tackle this issue by using backorders, where an item that is currently unavailable but still in production, is promised to be shipped within a specified timeframe. This is a winwin for both the customer and the retailer, since the sale is made for the retailer, and the customer gets the product they want. However, managing backorders can present challenges. If an order cannot be fulfilled as promised, it may lead to greater customer dissatisfaction compared to when the item is just out of stock. Additionally, handling backorders poses logistical and financial challenges for the company. Implementing backorders in your business requires careful consideration. What is a Backorder? When an item is unavailable in a sellers inventory but is still in production or obtainable from the distributor, the customer may be allowed to make the purchase. This purchase order is registered as a backorder, and the seller makes the promise to fulfill it within a specified timeframe. Backorders, sometimes also referred to as a backlog, signal that the demand for a specific product exceeds what the seller has produced or ordered. This situation might result from inadequate planning, issues within the supply chain, strict policies regarding safety stock, or an unexpected surge in demand for the item. When considering whether your business should offer backorders, its advisable to avoid enabling them for low-cost or readily available commodity products that customers can easily obtain elsewhere. If you do decide to offer backorders, ensure that the profit margin justifies the additional logistical efforts and that you can promptly fulfill those requests. The duration it takes to deliver a back ordered item to the customer depends on various factors To estimate the length of time for a backorder, consider these factors Capacity for Customer Service Dealing with backorders means extra steps and exceptions. Companies equipped with automated order management systems and robust exception handling mechanisms, or those utilizing third-party logistics providers (3PL), can efficiently handle reorders and fulfillment. Rules of the Marketplace Retailers operating on platforms like Amazon or eBay might opt against accepting backorders due to platform regulations, such as stringent fulfillment deadlines where the restock date typically needs to fall within 30 days of the sale. Your Supply Chain The longer and more complex a supply chain is for an item on backorder, the longer it will take to acquire sufficient stock to meet demand. Theres a higher probability of the item going out of stock before fulfilling backorders. Capabilities for Dropshipping Whenever possible, streamlining processes by directly dropshipping back-ordered items from the manufacturer or distributor accelerates fulfillment. Backorders vs Out of Stock When an item is unavailable for purchase because the seller lacks inventory and cannot provide a definite restock date, or if the item is part of a seasonal or limited production, it is considered out of stock. Backordered items are anticipated to become available within a reasonable timeframe. How Backorders Function When a company accepts orders, including potential payments for products not currently in stock, it is engaging in backorders. After accepting backorders, the warehouse management system converts them into purchase orders and forwards them to the appropriate internal department, vendor, or distributor. Customer service teams should inform buyers of an estimated delivery time and explain the payment process. Retailers might opt to have the supplier ship items directly to customers, or they may receive the items themselves, convert the backorders into sales orders, and ship them to customers after charging their accounts, if applicable.",

After accepting backorders, the warehouse management system converts them into purchase orders and forwards them to the appropriate internal department, vendor, or distributor. Customer service teams should inform buyers of an estimated delivery time and explain the payment process. Retailers might opt to have the supplier ship items directly to customers, or they may receive the items themselves, convert the backorders into sales orders, and ship them to customers after charging their accounts, if applicable. For a limited number of product codes at a manageable volume, this process is relatively straightforward. However, complications arise when the number or quantity of backordered items increases, or when retailers rely heavily on manual order processes and must align each purchase order with a corresponding sales order during fulfillment. What is the Purpose of Backorders? Backorders serve several purposes for companies. For retailers with limited warehouse space, holding a large stock may not be feasible. However, if they can reliably monitor item availability from suppliers, they can prevent overcrowding and excessive storage expenses while confidently accepting backorders. At times, companies experience unexpected spikes in product demand. Again, contingent upon their ability to monitor additional stock availability, accepting backorders enables retailers to capitalize on those sales opportunities and maintain customer satisfaction. Small suppliers that primarily rely on drop shipping often routinely accept backorders and place orders with the supplier only once backorders reach a certain threshold. This approach allows these companies to completely avoid inventory holding costs. Impact of Backorders on Supply Chains Backorders have repercussions throughout supply chains, imposing additional responsibilities on distributors and manufacturers. In fulfilling backorders, suppliers must generate or acquire extra stock beyond their regular inventory. If theres insufficient product to fulfill these orders, the pressure is passed up the supply chain, or retailers may be compelled to cancel backorders. These abrupt shifts in demand can trigger whats termed a bullwhip effect, characterized by an exaggerated response within the supply chain. The farther removed an entity is from the source of backorder demand, the more uncertainty is introduced. For instance, overseas suppliers distant from retailers are unlikely to receive prompt information regarding the causes of backorders. Consequently, they may opt to bolster production to ensure they can meet downstream demandeven if the backorders stemmed from an anomaly, such as an unanticipated heatwave prompting a surge in demand for AC filters in October. Consequently, overall supply chain costs escalate, and retailers may find themselves saddled with surplus inventory. Understanding the Causes of Backorders Addressing the underlying causes of backorders represents the initial stage in either preventing or minimizing their occurrence. Lets examine some common reasons for backorders, which can be viewed as manifestations of inaccurate forecasting and can consequently be alleviated through enhanced inventory forecasting Unusual demand or demand surpassing supply Occurrences like holiday seasons or unexpected events such as extreme weather conditions may result in atypical purchasing patterns. Inaccurate forecasting Less precise forecasts may result in inadequate safety stock levels and an increased likelihood of backorders. Supplier or manufacturing challenges Issues within the supply chain, such as factory closures or shortages of raw materials, can unexpectedly lead to items being out of stock. Delayed orders Companies relying on safety stock formulas and requiring manual review of purchase orders may encounter delays in restocking, followed by sudden surges in orders. If a companys upstream supplier has not replenished stock, there may be delays, leading to backorders. Human errors An employee might mistakenly designate an order as a",

Supplier or manufacturing challenges Issues within the supply chain, such as factory closures or shortages of raw materials, can unexpectedly lead to items being out of stock. Delayed orders Companies relying on safety stock formulas and requiring manual review of purchase orders may encounter delays in restocking, followed by sudden surges in orders. If a companys upstream supplier has not replenished stock, there may be delays, leading to backorders. Human errors An employee might mistakenly designate an order as a backorder even when the item is available. Alternatively, a retailer may accept a backorder despite the item being out of stock, either due to an error or due to delays in inventory updates. Accounting for Backorders Even when equipped with suitable warehouse management systems, handling backorders typically requires different procedures in accounting and customer service. This is because the company must inform buyers about the backorder, specify when they will be charged, and provide an estimated delivery date. A companys backlog is typically classified as a subset of sales, indicated either by a dollar amount or the number of units sold or ordered. Instead of treating it as a finalized transaction, the backorder is logged as such in the companys records. This approach prevents the need for the company to adjust its accounting records if the customer cancels the order or if the company is unable to procure the stock. Upon recording a backorder, the company proceeds to place the order. Upon receiving the items, the company fulfills the order, delivering the product in accordance with the customers purchase order. Alternatively, the items may be drop-shipped directly. Then, the sale is documented and marked as complete. Its crucial for companies to assess backorder rates, along with other essential inventory Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics, such as forecast accuracy and time to receive. The backorder rate KPI indicates the proportion of a customers total orders that involve items on backorder, resulting in delayed delivery. It reflects a companys effectiveness in stocking high-demand products. To calculate the backorder rate, use the following formula Backorder rate (number of delayed backorders total number of orders placed) x 100 Managing Backorder Fulfillment Ideally, the optimal approach to handling backorders is to not need to accept them. However, in reality, most sellers will encounter this scenario. In such cases, investing in a warehouse management system becomes essential, as it can prevent customer dissatisfaction by providing accurate and real-time data for decision-making. Moreover, it can compile insights based on seasonal trends to forecast supplier performance and anticipate spikes in demand. Businesses that effectively manage inventory flows in accordance with supplier lead times and adjust purchase orders based on real-time data can prevent stockouts, particularly during periods of peak sales potential. When faced with the need to fulfill backorders, follow a 5-step process Make amends Assess whether expressing gratitude to affected customers for their patience through a shipping upgrade or including a complimentary low-cost item is appropriate. Inform the customer of the expected delivery date range. Explore whether the customer has placed additional orders that could be bundled with the back-ordered item. Convert the backorder into a sales order and authorize shipment. Process payment or generate an invoice. Dispatch the item and finalize the sale. But dont end it there. If there is a substantial number of backorders, consider recalibrating reorder points, establishing a higher safety stock threshold, or reevaluating the inventory forecasting procedure.

If there is a substantial number of backorders, consider recalibrating reorder points, establishing a higher safety stock threshold, or reevaluating the inventory forecasting procedure. Best Practices for Managing Backorders While some backorders may be inevitable, its advisable to adopt best practices to minimize them, thus reducing the risk of a negative impact on your supply chain, such as the bullwhip effect, and addressing challenges like customer dissatisfaction, extended fulfillment periods, and increased backend complexity. Leading retailers employ the following strategies Consolidate backordered items from a customers order before notification, shipping, or billing. Establish a timeframe for keeping backorders open and active. The duration varies depending on the business but typically lasts around 30 days. Make diligent efforts to procure back-ordered items within the specified timeframe, even if it involves higher costs or manual processes. Notify customers promptly if an item cannot be shipped within the designated timeframe and log an entry in your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to send an email notification if the item becomes available in the future. Additional best practices to consider implementing include Maintain open communication with supply chain partnersestablishing transparent lines of communication with both upstream and downstream partners reduces assumptions and minimizes the likelihood of overestimating or underestimating demand. Educate employees about the drawbacks of backorders and emphasize the importance of delivering exceptional customer service. Five Strategies for Reducing Backorders Reducing backorders is achievable through a strategic blend of business methodologies and technological solutions. Here are some steps to consider Understand your customers preferences and requirements Prioritize inventory items based on their significance to customers, allowing you to be discerning about increasing safety stock levels. For instance, a restaurant proprietor may be less forgiving of potatoes being backordered compared to an exotic fruit. Given the low cost of stocking ample potatoes, theres little justification for running out of them. Conversely, suppose a crucial ingredient for your largest customers popular dish is costly and challenging to source, and repeated backorders risk driving them to alternative suppliers. In that case, its crucial to maintain a reliable supply chain. Seek Real-Time Data and Reporting Securing accurate and near-real-time data reporting serves two essential purposes firstly, it ensures that your warehouse is promptly alerted to restock items, thus reducing the likelihood of purchasing delays that result in backorders. Secondly, it enables proper customer notificationideally at the point of purchaseregarding back-ordered items, empowering them to decide whether to retain them in their carts. Implement System Triggers These triggers can vary from basic alerts indicating low stock levels to automated notifications to customers regarding the status of their orders or the arrival of new shipments for frequently purchased items. Establish Backup or Contingency Plans In instances of backorders, savvy sellers go to great lengths to avoid disappointing valued customers. This may involve sourcing from local suppliers or even procuring the item elsewhere at retail prices. Diversify Suppliers Manufacturers or suppliers may also encounter periods of peak demand, whether planned or unplanned. Hence, ordering from a diverse range of sources is integral to sound supply chain management. This process begins with timely purchase orders and involves performance monitoring, including metrics such as productivity, costs, fill rates, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction.

    "text": "ABC analysis is a method in inventory management aimed at assessing the significance of inventory items to a business. It involves evaluating items based on factors such as demand, cost, and risk data, after which inventory managers classify them into different categories. This classification aids business leaders in understanding the crucial products or services vital for their organizations financial success. The top-priority stock-keeping units (SKUs), determined by factors like sales volume or profitability, are designated as Class A items, followed by Class B and then Class C for less critical items. Some companies might opt for a more nuanced classification system, extending beyond the traditional A-C categorization, such as A-F. While ABC analysis in inventory management focuses on prioritizing inventory items, ABC analysis in cost accounting, also known as activity-based costing, serves a different purpose. In cost accounting, activity-based costing is utilized in manufacturing to allocate indirect or overhead costs, like utilities or salaries, to products and services. ABC Analysis and the Pareto Principle The Pareto Principle suggests that a significant portion of outcomes stem from a minority of efforts or factors within a system, typically around 20. Applying Paretos 8020 principle, ABC analysis pinpoints the top 20 of products that contribute roughly 80 of the overall value. Consequently, many businesses possess a limited number of A items, followed by a slightly larger cluster of B products, and a substantial grouping of C goods, which represent the majority of items. Classes in ABC Inventory Management Type Importance Percentage of Total Inventory Annual Consumption Value Controls Records Class A High Dollar Value 10 20 70 80 Tight High Accuracy Class B Medium Dollar Value 30 15 20 Medium Good Class C Low Dollar Value 50 5 Basic Minimal While the Pareto Principle may not always be perfectly accurate, analysis often reveals an approximate 8020 distribution of value. ABC analysis effectively pinpoints the core revenue drivers of a business with minimal effort. Calculation of ABC Inventory Analysis To conduct ABC inventory analysis, multiply the annual sales of each item by its cost. This calculation highlights which items are high priority and which ones generate low profits, enabling you to allocate human and capital resources more effectively. Heres the formula for ABC inventory analysis (Number of items sold annually) x (Cost per item) (Usage value per product annually) You can perform a basic ABC inventory analysis using Microsoft Excel. Arrange each product or resource in descending order based on its annual usage value. Calculate the total value of all items. Then, determine the thresholds for the A, B, and C categories, and assign each item to its corresponding group. The items with the highest value warrant the most attention from management. How ABC Analysis Simplifies Work for Inventory Managers Inventory managers continually seek methods to enhance pricing, quality, and operational efficiency. With this objective in mind, they often employ the ABC technique, also known as the always better control method. This approach enables them to concentrate their resources primarily on Class A inventory items while allocating fewer resources to B and C class products. For instance, inventory managers prioritize checking purchase orders for Class A items, which yield the highest revenue. Video ABC Analysis in Inventory Management Why Use ABC Analysis? Utilizing ABC analysis in inventory management enhances control over working capital expenses. Insights obtained from this analysis facilitate the reduction of obsolete inventory and have the potential to increase the inventory turnover rate, indicating how frequently a business replenishes items after selling them.

ABC Analysis Benefits Enhanced Inventory Management Through thorough analysis, identify high-demand products to optimize warehouse space allocation, ensuring adequate stock levels for profitable items while minimizing inventory of lower-demand ones. Refined Sales Projection By meticulously monitoring data on popular products, refine sales forecasts for informed inventory management, potentially boosting company revenue by setting optimal inventory levels and prices. Optimized Pricing Strategy Capitalize on increased demand by adjusting prices accordingly, enhancing profitability for specific items experiencing heightened sales. Strategic Supplier Negotiations Prioritize negotiating favorable terms for high-revenue Class A items, exploring various avenues for cost savings or added value if direct cost reductions are not feasible. Efficient Resource Allocation Continuously evaluate resource allocation based on ABC analysis to align with shifting customer demand, optimizing personnel, time, and space allocation. Enhanced Customer Experience Tailor service levels based on profitability, focusing on high-margin items to improve overall customer satisfaction. Improved Product Lifecycle Management Gain insights into product lifecycle stages to accurately forecast demand and adjust inventory levels accordingly. Effective Management of High-Value Inventory Maintain healthy stock levels and closely monitor demand for Class A items to ensure sustained company success. Optimized Stock Turnover Maintain appropriate stock turnover rates through meticulous inventory control and data analysis. Reduced Storage Costs Optimize inventory proportions for each class (A, B, C) to minimize carrying costs associated with excess inventory. Streamlined Supply Chain Operations Utilize ABC analysis to streamline supplier relationships, potentially consolidating or transitioning to a single source to reduce costs and simplify operations. The Limitations of ABC Analysis Despite its numerous advantages in inventory maintenance and management, ABC analysis doesnt offer a universal solution applicable to all organizations. Each organization possesses distinct customer demand patterns, classification systems, and other factors that influence the relevance of ABC analysis. The drawbacks of ABC analysis arise from two main factors its focus on the monetary value of inventory and the considerable time and effort required for its implementation. Below are additional challenges Instability in Parameters Up to 50 of items are reallocated to a new category each quarter or year due to ABC analysis. Often, companies become aware of these changes only when demand issues arise, necessitating reassessment that consumes valuable time and risks compromising customer satisfaction. Limited Consideration of Patterns The conventional ABC method overlooks factors such as new product launches or seasonal variations in products. For instance, a newly introduced product may initially have low sales due to its lack of purchase history. This static perspective of demand in ABC analysis can lead to inventory inefficiencies whenever there are shifts or uncertainties in demand. Insufficient Information Extraction The classification information provided by ABC may not offer all the necessary statistical data or detailed insights required for making strategic management decisions. High Resource Consumption The tendency to overly focus on trivial matters, known as bikeshedding, can unfortunately occur with ABC analysis. Its simplicity may lead staff to introduce their opinions or request modifications, turning ABC analysis into a resource-intensive process rather than a time-saving tool. Blindness to Value ABC analysis assesses product importance based on usage frequency, which may not align with certain items actual significance. For",

Its simplicity may lead staff to introduce their opinions or request modifications, turning ABC analysis into a resource-intensive process rather than a time-saving tool. Blindness to Value ABC analysis assesses product importance based on usage frequency, which may not align with certain items actual significance. For instance, a retail display item may have infrequent sales but attract numerous customers, driving sales of other products. Similarly, in aerospace, a specific plane part may have low usage frequency and market value but hold critical safety functions. System Incompatibility ABC inventory analysis clashes with traditional costing systems and falls short of meeting generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requirements. Implementing multiple costing systems can escalate labor costs and inefficiencies. Issues with Under or Overstocking One drawback of ABC analysis is its reliance on dollar values rather than the volume of inventory turnover, which can lead to the risk of shortages of Class B or C items. Conversely, overstocking of lower-class items may occur if reordering happens without regular reviews. Risk of Loss Despite B and C items having lower values compared to Class A products, they still hold value. ABC analysis limitations include the constant risk of excess inventory becoming obsolete or damaged, especially when inventory is left uncounted or unmonitored, increasing vulnerability to theft. Necessity of Standardization Successful implementation of the ABC method hinges on the standardization of materials for every item, encompassing naming conventions, storage procedures, and consistent evaluation and monitoring practices. Subjective Categorization The absence of predetermined boundaries or universally agreed-upon standards for each category results in goods classification relying heavily on managerial discretion, making the process somewhat subjective. Limitations Based on Business Type ABC analysis may not apply to businesses with uniform annual consumption values across inventory items of the same type. For example, companies selling identical versions of items like candy, nails, or socks may struggle to categorize stock according to the Pareto Principle. Resource Intensiveness Companies with a large inventory item count may need to allocate additional personnel or invest in specialized equipment to effectively manage inventory using ABC categorization. The Process of ABC Analysis To conduct a comprehensive ABC analysis, start by defining the objective you aim to achieve. Once established, gather the necessary data for item classification. Once the categories are set, closely monitor and base decisions on the resultant data. Heres a breakdown of the steps involved in performing an ABC analysis Define the Objective Determine whether your goal is to reduce procurement expenses or enhance cash flow by optimizing inventory levels of key items based on customer sales or production needs. Gather Data The primary data to collect typically includes the annual expenditure on each item, represented in raw purchase dollars. If feasible, you can also compile weighted costs, incorporating factors like gross profit margin, ordering costs, and carrying costs. Arrange in Descending Order of Impact Utilize the ABC analysis formula to rank each inventory item based on its cost, arranging them in descending order of impact, from highest to lowest. Determine the Sales Impact Calculate the sales impact of each inventory item as a percentage by dividing its annual cost by the total expenditure on all items. This percentage serves as a basis for comparing items in the list. Heres the formula impact (annual item cost) (total expenditure on",

Heres the formula impact (annual item cost) (total expenditure on all items) x 100 Classify Items into Purchase Categories After establishing the categories, focus on activities such as renegotiating contracts, consolidating vendors, adjusting strategic sourcing approaches, or implementing e-procurement. These changes can lead to significant savings or ensure the availability of Class A items in stock. Its advisable to adopt a comprehensive perspective rather than strictly adhering to the 8020 rule. Evaluate Categories Once the classifications and strategic cost management strategies are defined, schedule regular reviews to assess the effectiveness or shortcomings of decisions. Best Practices for ABC Analysis Best practices for ABC analysis emphasize consistency, sales monitoring, and vigilance regarding events that could impact stock levels or value. Leveraging technology for inventory management is a recommended approach that streamlines the entire process. Implement the following best practices when conducting an ABC analysis Simplify Classifications Classify items based on their frequency of movement within your organization. Items with high turnover rates are more susceptible to stockouts. Alternatively, you can categorize items according to their value or gross profit margin. Class A would comprise the highest-priced items, Class B the moderately priced ones, and Class C the least expensive ones. Simultaneously Determine Service and Labor Levels Set service levels based on the class of each item. Class A products should have the highest service level targets, while those in the lowest class should have the lowest targets. For example, managers might allocate 10 hours to review 100 Class A items and the same time to review 10,000 Class C items. Schedule cycle counting according to classification, ensuring more frequent counting for Class A items (which have the most significant impact on sales performance) than for Class B and C items. Segment KPIs by Class Establish distinct key performance indicators (KPIs), generate corresponding reports, and develop dashboards for each class. Conduct Performance Evaluations Perform performance evaluations during comprehensive inventory maintenance or according to schedules and protocols tied to ABC classifications. Assess Excess Inventory Evaluate whether your current surplus inventory levels align with your companys needs. In todays global, just-in-time economy, excessive inventory may entail unnecessary risks and holding costs. If retaining this inventory is justified, ensure it is categorized correctly. Implement Cross-Location Management Supply chain managers should have the capability to oversee inventory across multiple physical locations. Track Inventory in Transit Monitor the duration between the shipment and receipt dates when inventory moves between locations. Such audits help maintain accurate inventory records and enable prompt identification of damage or loss. Strategically Reclassify Maintain flexibility in the timing and methodology of inventory reclassification. Periodic reclassification may be necessary due to market fluctuations, shifts in customer demographics or purchasing behaviors, the emergence of new popular products, or changes in key performance indicators (KPIs) or business strategies. Consider Sales and Inventory in Conjunction Acknowledge the correlation between sales and inventory levels. With increasing sales, inventory turnover rises, necessitating restocking according to anticipated schedules. Conversely, market downturns may prompt a reassessment of item classifications and stock levels. Additionally, review pricing and promotional strategies based on item",

Harness Technology and Utilize Data Inventory managers employ automated systems to streamline replenishment processes, identify surges in demand, and prevent fulfillment issues. Utilize data to effectively manage lead times and forecast demand. Utilizing ABC Analysis for Cycle Counting Cycle counts entail periodic inventory checks conducted throughout the business year. ABC analysis ensures more frequent counting of critical, high-volume items. With cycle counting, the accuracy of the inventory records in the warehouse management system can be cross-checked and verified. Scheduled cycle counts can be organized by classification, ensuring that Class A itemsthose with the most significant impact on sales performanceare counted more regularly than Class B and C items. How to Implement ABC Inventory Management To effectively implement ABC inventory management, its crucial to evaluate its suitability for your business beforehand. Avoid making assumptions by posing critical questions. Upon deciding to proceed, undertake any essential preparations to facilitate a seamless execution. Utilize the following questionnaire to gauge your readiness for ABC analysis implementation. If you answer No to any questions, further preparation is necessary before undertaking an ABC analysis Issue Query YesNo Gathering Information Is there reliable, accessible and item-specific demand and cost data?

    "text": "Investing in yard management and a logistics network is a significant commitment for businesses and a crucial factor in gaining a competitive edge. Recent years have shown considerable fluctuations in demand and supply, highlighting the necessity for precise real-time coordination of all logistical processes to optimize service levels and asset utilization. Among the various components of logistics, yard operations are frequently neglected. These involve the physical areas within warehouse premises, distribution centers, and manufacturing plants where incoming and outgoing shipments are managed. Apart from static infrastructure like gates and loading docks, the yard comprises dynamic elements such as trucks, trailers, cargo, and staff. As businesses strive to enhance their logistics networks, they must recognize the significant strategic and financial benefits of this intricate and costly domain. Through efficient optimization of the monitoring, coordination and scheduling, companies can lower expenses to boost profitability, while simultaneously improving the quality of service. With increasing awareness of the value of yard optimization, the demand for solutions in dock and yard management is on the rise. Initially valued at 3.1 billion in 2021, this market is anticipated to expand to 7.82 billion by 2030, indicating a yearly growth rate of 11.26. Video What is Yard Management? How Does It Improve Warehouse Operations? Understanding Yards A yard typically serves as an extension of the warehouse, making it essential for inventory control. Upon check-in of a trailer, it might require guidance to an assigned dock door or an unoccupied one within the yard. If no dock doors are available, it may be directed to an empty parking spot within the yard. The information channel should be managed to enable the system to automatically route the trailer according to a predetermined schedule. What is Yard Management? Yard management involves the organization, coordination, and guidance of various assets, including incoming and outgoing trucks, trailers, shipments, personnel, and other resources, within the dock and yard areas of a facility. To attain a competitive edge, companies must pursue numerous objectives optimizing inventory control, reducing inventory levels, shortening order processing times, enhancing fill rates, and streamlining the flow of inventory both within warehouse premises and across yard spaces. Through effective yard management, your company can optimize the flow of inventory within the yard areas of manufacturing facilities, warehouses, or distribution centers. You can establish the necessary entities for yard management and capture real-time transactions occurring within the yard. This allows for tracking the whereabouts of trailers within the yard and empowers yard personnel to efficiently move trailers from parking areas to docks to fulfill orders. The complexities of yard management are on the rise, and recent disruptions in the supply chain have prompted many organizations to scrutinize their yard operations for opportunities to enhance efficiency. What are the goals of dock yard management? Efficient operation through time-optimized process chains Enhanced capacities and productivity Access to real-time information Quicker dispatching of trucks Enhanced transparency across all processes Cost-cutting measures Yard Management Challenges Yard management poses unique challenges for each organization, contingent upon factors such as company size, yard size, the range of products present, among others. Through surveys with yard operations personnel around the world, the following key issues have emerged Inadequate Trailer Visibility Yard teams face difficulties in tracking available trailer assets within the yard (and potentially inventory), resulting in inefficient trailer movement, increased costs, and reduced efficiency in operations. The inability to monitor vehicle locations within the warehouse adds to the disorder and inefficiency.

The inability to monitor vehicle locations within the warehouse adds to the disorder and inefficiency. Insufficient Shipment Visibility Yard teams lack comprehensive foresight regarding the arrival times of trucks for loading or unloading, leading to suboptimal utilization of the yard and its assets. This situation also exacerbates gate congestion and significantly raises demurragedetention fees. Furthermore, there exists a dearth of visibility concerning backorder fulfillment rates, cross-docking vehicles, and dock operations, including dock-in, operation start, operation end, and dock-out times. Process Misalignment Transportation, warehouse, and yard processes are often overseen through disparate yard and dock management systems, companies, or tools that lack dynamic updates or digital maintenance, fostering reactive operations. Consequently, stakeholders lack real-time insights, resulting in inefficient utilization of warehouse dock doors, labor, and equipment, along with increased expenses. Additionally, inadequate utilization of transportation resources leads to prolonged wait times, elevated costs, and delays, potentially straining customer relationships. Yard Jockey Inefficiency A deficiency in understanding yard operations leads to ineffective deployment of yard jockeys and an inability to monitor operations for safety and compliance. This deficiency contributes to escalated violations and expenses, as well as squandered jockey labor and deficient planning. Benefits of Yard Management Trailer yards often become opaque areas within the supply chain due to limited visibility. Yard management software addresses this issue by providing clarity on the whereabouts of trailers and shipments. By implementing yard management software, manufacturing, distribution, and asset-intensive companies can enhance their order fulfillment and logistics operations by extending visibility and automating processes within the yard. This leads to improved productivity and decreased costs. Key benefits include Enhanced trailer management and visibility across various facilities and the entire enterprise. Streamlined dock operations through collaborative dock scheduling. Decreased expenses linked to stock-outs, detention, and demurrage. Improved fulfillment and logistics through integrated warehousing and transportation. Increased throughput for both the yard and serviced facilities. Effective coordination of all operations through dock and yard management prevents lengthy queues at gateways, thereby reducing costly periods of inactivity, as logistics operations are interconnected in an efficient network. In essence, dock and yard management guarantees heightened safety, decreased overall cost of ownership, and enhanced throughput. The flow of traffic within the facility is economically organized, facilitating optimal utilization of the infrastructure. With dock and yard management, all data is digitally accessible in real-time, facilitating rapid and seamless communication. Additionally, yard management facilitates optimized resource employment and effective coordination of all logistical activities.

    "text": "Days sales in inventory, alternatively referred to as days in inventory (DII), days in inventory outstanding (DIO), or inventory days of supply, serves as a measure indicating the number of days a business maintains its inventory based on sales value. A common misunderstanding is associating days sales in inventory solely with the time required to deplete inventory. While a days sales in inventory of 40 days might suggest that inventory will be sold out within that timeframe if only one product type is sold, in reality, days sales in inventory calculates the average inventory turnover in terms of dollars, especially in cases where multiple products are involved. Within the 40-day period, certain products may cycle through inventory multiple times, while others may have longer sales cycles. Days sales in inventory originates from a fundamental query common for business proprietors and managers How long will my inventory last? The conventional method of calculating days sales in inventory, based on financial records, quantifies this duration in monetary terms, averaged over time. Essentially, days sales in inventory indicates the average duration required for cumulative sales to match the mean (or current) inventory level. This averaged metric, typically computed over a recent quarter or year, serves as a tool for both companies and investors to assess, in relative terms, the efficiency and effectiveness of sales and inventory management practices. An increase in days sales in inventory typically signifies either an excess inventory accumulation or a slowdown in sales. Conversely, a lower days sales in inventory is generally preferred, although the optimal threshold varies across industries and companies. It is imperative to maintain days sales in inventory above zero to avoid the risk of inventory levels dropping dangerously low, which could impede order fulfillment capabilities. Days sales in inventory serves as a valuable tool for planning, provided that the averages dont overlook significant cyclical fluctuations. For instance, in businesses with seasonal patterns, relying solely on an annual average might not offer meaningful insights. Additionally, its crucial that no significant alterations occur in your cost structure or sales environment from the start to end of the data period being analyzed for planning purposes. This means that if anticipated changes, such as implementing a new supply chain or launching a new product, are expected to impact future DSI, historical DSI data may become less relevant for planners. Why Businesses Should Care About Days Sales in Inventory Days sales in inventory serves as an indicator of operational effectiveness While a solitary figure for a specific period may lack significance on its own, continuous monitoring of days sales in inventory over time can reveal fluctuations and patterns that offer insights into inventory management practices. For instance, a gradual decrease in days sales in inventory might suggest successful implementation of a new sales approach, whereas a sudden increase could signal potential issues. (Its important to note that days sales in inventory alone shouldnt be relied upon to diagnose problematic situations.) Additionally, days sales in inventory facilitates comparisons between similar companies within the same industry over identical time frames. Days sales in inventory plays a crucial role in managing cash effectively Having excessive cash tied up in inventory can lead to various challenges, such as difficulties in meeting supplier payment deadlines or seizing new investment opportunities due to constrained finances. Additionally, for many businesses, the costs associated with storing inventory can be significant. Monitoring days sales in inventory helps preempt such issues from arising.

Additionally, for many businesses, the costs associated with storing inventory can be significant. Monitoring days sales in inventory helps preempt such issues from arising. Days sales in inventory serves as a pivotal aspect of inventory management. While a retrospective analysis of past performance using traditional formulas can offer insights into previous quarters or years, applying the same methodology to sales forecasts and current inventory status, especially when meticulously tracked through Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), provides valuable foresight into the businesss trajectory. Days sales in inventory computations hold particular significance for companies primarily or exclusively dealing in tangible goods, especially those involving perishable inventory. A high days sales in inventory for perishable products could lead to substantial financial losses, contrasting with standard inventory where an increase in days sales in inventory indicates slightly elevated carrying costs and marginally reduced liquidity. Calculate Days Sales in Inventory There are various methods to compute it, but the most common days sales in inventory formula is Days sales in inventory (average inventory) (COGS) x (days in the given time period) Average inventory refers to the mean monetary value (not inventory units) of inventory held during a specified duration, while COGS represents the cost of goods sold for that corresponding period. For an annual assessment, one would divide the average inventory for the year by the COGS of that year, and then multiply the outcome by the number of days in that year. In cases where a company manufactures its own goods, the inventory calculation should include works in progress as well. Its important to note that the outcomes derived from this approach heavily depend on how average inventory is calculated. The conventional method involves summing the beginning inventory and ending inventory for the specified time period and dividing the total by two. However, consider two companies operating on a January 1 to December 31 fiscal year. Suppose both companies commence the year with 1,000,000 of inventory and conclude with 1,200,000 of inventory. Both companies would report an average inventory level of 1.1 million. However, if one companys inventory surges from 1 million to 3 million before declining to 1.1 million by year-end, while the other companys inventory drops to 500,000 before rebounding to the same endpoint, these average calculations might obscure significant annual trends and fail to represent an average day for either company accurately. The formula can be adjusted slightly to provide a more future-oriented perspective, indicating the number of forthcoming days of inventory available at the present moment. To achieve this, substitute average inventory with the current inventory level (or the most recent available), while retaining the remaining components of the formula unchanged. This version operates on the assumption that the cost structure and sales rate of the current inventory will not significantly deviate from those observed during the time period specified for days and COGS. Days Sales in Inventory vs Inventory Turnover Inventory turnover complements days sales in inventory by providing additional insight into inventory management. While days sales in inventory indicates the average duration for a business to sell its inventory, inventory turnover reveals how many times, on average, the business replenished its inventory within a specified timeframe. Both days sales in inventory and inventory turnover share conceptual and mathematical similarities. For instance, if a businesss days",

While days sales in inventory indicates the average duration for a business to sell its inventory, inventory turnover reveals how many times, on average, the business replenished its inventory within a specified timeframe. Both days sales in inventory and inventory turnover share conceptual and mathematical similarities. For instance, if a businesss days sales in inventory for the previous fiscal year amounted to seven days (one week), its inventory turnover would be 52, reflecting the number of weeks in a year. Similarly, if days sales in inventory corresponds to a month, the inventory turnover would be 12. Its important to recognize that like days sales in inventory, inventory turnover is an average measure, which implies that it may conceal the actual time required for selling each individual item in inventory. Put differently, certain products may have faster turnover rates than others. Benefits of Calculating Days Sales in Inventory A primary advantage of computing days sales in inventory lies in its utility for benchmarking. By evaluating its performance against publicly traded rivals and its own historical data, a business can gauge its standing. A consistent decline in days sales in inventory may indicate enhancements in inventory management or sales prediction methods, whereas a reversal in this trend could serve as a warning signal, prompting leaders to investigate potential issues with personnel or suppliers that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Furthermore, DSIs trajectory over time, combined with other pertinent metrics, can offer valuable insights to guide strategic decision-making processes. When engaging in benchmarking, its essential for a business to ensure comparability by comparing similar entities. For instance, if a business specializes in selling phones, it would be inappropriate to benchmark against a company like Apple, which offers a broader range of products including computers and digital music. Similarly, quarter-over-quarter comparisons may lead to misleading conclusions for seasonal businesses. Additionally, some investors value insights provided by days sales in inventory. Therefore, if a companys financial statements are not publicly available or regularly reviewed, including the days sales in inventory calculation in reports and presentations could help investors make informed choices. Examples of Days Sales in Inventory Lets explore several methods for calculating days sales in inventory using a prominent publicly traded company that primarily deals in physical products Walmart. Their basic financial statement data is readily available. Example 1 From the conclusion of fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, Walmart experienced an increase in inventory from 8.99 billion to 10.65 billion. During fiscal year 2021, its total cost of goods sold (COGS) amounted to 65.7 billion. To determine Walmarts days sales in inventory for fiscal year 2021, we employ the following formula Days sales in inventory (average inventory)(COGS) x (days in the specified time period) In this instance, the average inventory is calculated as (8.99B 10.65B) 2 9.82B, and COGS equals 65.7B. Therefore, days sales in inventory (9.82B 65.7B) x 365 54.6 days Example 2 Lets consider a scenario where our interest lies more in obtaining the most current data available rather than assessing Walmarts performance over the entire year. In this case, we will base our calculation on the most recent quarter instead of the entire fiscal year, and well utilize the ending inventory figure instead of computing an average. As per the provided data, the cost of goods sold (COGS) amounted to 18.13",

As per the provided data, the cost of goods sold (COGS) amounted to 18.13 billion, while inventory stood at 14.96 billion. Utilizing our days sales in inventory formula Days sales in inventory (14.96B18.13B) x 90 74.3 days We observe a notably higher outcome for this latest quarteran increase of over a third. So, what insights do these figures offer? Analyzing the findings Historically, the outcomes of both computations exhibit an upward trend compared to previous periods, with the quarterly days sales in inventory surpassing that of the same quarter from the preceding year. It appears that the most recent quarter significantly influences the overall increase in days sales in inventory for the entire year. Given the positive sales growth observed in recent quarters and across recent years, one might question whether Walmarts efficiency in inventory management and sales forecasting has diminished. Plausible narratives could revolve around labor shortages and challenges within the supply chain. However, an alternative interpretation could suggest that the escalation in inventory levels represents a strategic response to supply chain complexities, particularly in anticipation of the high shopping demand during the winter holiday season when stock outs could prove exceptionally costly. Augmenting inventories may be a deliberate strategy to mitigate potential shortages and adopt a cautious approach. An alternative explanation is that Walmart anticipated faster sales growth compared to previous years. Its important to note that the pace of sales is determined by historical COGS data therefore, if sales were to surge significantly, the entire 74 days might not be required to turn over inventory within a single quarter. So, should there be any cause for concern? Evidently, Walmart investors appear unfazed by this abrupt rise in a metric that some sources suggest could indicate declining efficiency. In fact, as of the present moment, Walmarts stock has outperformed the market over the past six-, and 12-month periods. With the confidence exhibited by Walmarts investors, coupled with the companys expanding business and the understanding that increasing inventory levels could be a prudent response to supply chain challenges and unpredictable spikes in demand, its reasonable to infer that this increase likely reflects a strategic shift rather than sudden inefficiency. This example shows us the limitation of relying solely on days sales in inventory to assess the vitality of a business, even when the numbers appear striking. How does Warehouse Management Software Help? Utilizing warehouse management software has become almost indispensable when leveraging days sales in inventory for decision-making purposes. The traditional method of computing days sales in inventory from financial statements, which can be time-consuming to compile and may not always reflect the most recent data, often falls short in providing comprehensive information, particularly in corporate forecasts, conducting what-if scenarios, or examining incomplete quarters or fiscal years.

    "text": "Cycle count vs physical count is a comparative analysis of two methods of counting inventory, and how and when they should be implemented. Precise inventory data plays a pivotal role in the success of a business as it directly impacts various aspects ranging from customer satisfaction to financial management. Inaccurate inventory counts lead to diminished service quality, decreased efficiency, and reduced profitability. Such discrepancies hinder companies ability to forecast effectively, often resulting in either excessive inventory orders or insufficient stock to meet customer demands. Nevertheless, maintaining precise inventory records presents its own set of challenges. Traditionally, many businesses have relied on labor-intensive periodic physical inventory checks, which can disrupt daily operations. However, an increasing number of companies are transitioning to a more adaptable and efficient method known as cycle counting. While certain accounting standards and tax regulations necessitate annual or semi-annual physical inventories, this article examines cycle count vs physical count thoroughly, aiding in the selection and implementation of the most suitable method for individual company needs. What is a Physical Count? During a traditional physical inventory check, a company allocates multiple days to tally each item in its inventory, spanning all storage facilities and other designated areas. This process yields a thorough count, serving as a vital mechanism to verify that the inventory reflected in the warehouse management system precisely matches what is physically present on the shelves. Typically conducted on a yearly basis, physical inventory checks are primarily scheduled annually due to their significant time requirements and potential disruptions to business operations. In practice, these counts often necessitate the temporary suspension of activities such as shipping and receiving for the duration of the count. Even with the utilization of technologies like radio frequency (RF) tags or other inventory-scanning methods, physical counts remain exceedingly labor-intensive. Historically, companies have regarded annual physical inventories as essential for commencing a new fiscal year equipped with accurate inventory data, enabling them to adjust their financial records and make informed business decisions. Entities with smaller inventory volumes often find the logistical demands of annual counts manageable and therefore see little incentive to deviate from this practice. What is a Cycle Count? In a cycle counting system, the company consistently conducts small-scale inventory checks, ensuring that all items are eventually accounted for within a specified timeframe. Employing sampling methodologies akin to those employed by survey researchers, companies extrapolate their findings to obtain progressively more precise insights into their overall inventory status. Upon initiating cycle counting procedures, companies might intentionally repeat counts of the same items to assess consistency among different counters. This practice aids in pinpointing and rectifying any issues in counting techniques, thereby promoting the adoption of best practices across the board and ensuring the delivery of precise inventory data. Cycle counting is often conducted on a daily basis. For instance, if a company needs to assess 1500 SKUs within a six-week timeframe, it can achieve this by counting approximately four or five SKUs per day, thus covering its entire inventory. Some companies assign specific personnel to handle cycle counting duties, integrating it into employees regular job responsibilities. To ensure the reliability and adequacy of cycle counting, companies typically collaborate with internal or external auditors. Over time, if cycle counting consistently proves accurate, auditors and accountants may deem it sufficient to replace full physical counts. Companies have a variety of options when it comes to selecting cycle counting techniques, each with its own set of priorities dictating which items receive more frequent attention. By sales This method, also known as ABC Analysis, 8020, or the Pareto Principle method, emphasizes counting items that contribute the",

By sales This method, also known as ABC Analysis, 8020, or the Pareto Principle method, emphasizes counting items that contribute the most value to a warehouse. It follows the Pareto principle, which suggests that 20 of SKUs typically generate 80 of sales due to their high cost or frequent turnover. Companies categorize items based on their sales (A, B, or C) and conduct cycle counts accordingly, with more frequent counts for A and B items. Its important to note that the categorization of items may change as business dynamics evolve. By area Another straightforward method involves organizing cycle counts based on the physical location of items. For instance, companies may count all items within a specific department, cabinet, floor area, or set of racks and bins. By usage This approach targets locationsSKUs that are frequently utilized that have seen movement in a specified period. Random counting This method involves randomly selecting SKUs throughout the warehouse for sampling during cycle counts. Hybrid approaches Companies often develop customized practices by blending different methods to align with their priorities. Hybrid plans frequently combine ABC analysis with other techniques. For instance, items categorized as A may undergo more frequent counting, but software may randomize which ones are counted on a particular day. Alternatively, companies might prioritize specific categories or adjust cycle counts to accommodate seasonal fluctuations in the sales of certain items. Why Cycle Counting is Effective For numerous companies, cycle counting presents notable benefits compared to traditional physical inventory checks. Firstly, it poses less disruption. As only a fraction of the inventory is assessed at any given time, normal business operations can proceed uninterrupted. Cycle counting entails a smaller ongoing effort throughout the year, which is typically more manageable than a single extensive count at year-end. With counts being conducted on a continuous basis, cycle counting can swiftly identify issues that might escalate if left unaddressed until the next comprehensive physical inventory check. Particularly in an era dominated by constant ecommerce transactions, this capability is increasingly significant. Additionally, companies can consistently monitor the accuracy of their inventory counts and refine counting methods or training protocols should any discrepancies arise. Cycle Count vs Physical Count Whats the Difference? Although both cycle counting and physical counts share the common objective of ensuring accurate inventory data, they employ distinct methodologies to achieve this goal. These variances have an effect on everyday warehouse activities. Below is a comparative overview of both approaches Physical Count Cycle Count Items Counted All items or all SKUs at once Certain over a particular period of time Information Offered Concrete and comprehensive information on the exact counts of each SKU in inventory A count of particular items on a regular basis Staffing Involves the participation of a large number of employees Dedicated to a team and incorporated into other employees responsibilities Types of Companies Companies with limited inventory where physical counting is not as disruptive.

Possibly for financial reporting. Companies with large, growing or complex inventory Level of Flexibility Minimal Substantial Level of Disruption High Low Schedule Occasionally (often annually) Continually (often every dayweek) Both inventory counting methodologies offer advantages for warehouse management. Annual physical counts typically involve a large-scale operation with limited flexibility and considerable short-term disruption to regular business operations. On the other hand, cycle counting is an ongoing process that seldom impedes other business activities. However, it necessitates regular attention and cannot be deferred for extended periods. While physical counts provide certainty regarding inventory levels at the commencement of a new fiscal year, cycle counting better aligns with the needs of many businesses for enhanced flexibility, adaptability, and real-time information crucial for informed decision-making. For instance, companies conducting regular cycle counts of vital SKUs or manufacturing components can prevent unnecessary orders and allocate their financial resources more effectively. It is vital that companies establish an approach that is disciplined and ensures adherence to schedules. Implementing cycle counting may entail coordination with accountants to guarantee the accuracy of counts, consistency in counting processes, and comprehensive coverage of inventory within the designated timelines. Moreover, when discrepancies arise between cycle counts and physical counts, businesses have a timely opportunity to enact improvements before issues escalate. However, this opportunity is contingent on managers promptly identifying and addressing the root causes of the identified problems. For example, they may discover that certain items are more prone to loss, spoilage, or theft than initially anticipated, necessitating enhanced measures for safeguarding. Continuous improvement is facilitated through cycle counting. Cycle Count vs Physical Count What is the Best Way? With the expansion and increasing intricacy of warehouses and similar establishments, conducting annual physical inventory counts becomes progressively challenging, laborious, and expensive, thereby enhancing the comparative significance of cycle count vs physical count for businesses. Certain companies adopt a blend of cycle counting and physical inventory checks. For instance, some retailers conduct cycle counts throughout the year, with a particular emphasis on high-demand items, followed by a comprehensive physical inventory check after the conclusion of the holiday season. Conversely, other businesses may opt for a final physical count to establish a robust baseline before transitioning to cycle counting methodologies. Deciding between cycle count vs physical count may sometimes not even be a choice. Regulatory requirements may necessitate an annual physical count. However, conducting periodic cycle counts reduce variance, i.e, the difference between book stock and actual stock, and helps complete the annual physical counts faster. Optimizing Your Counts with a Warehouse Management System Implementing cycle counting is significantly simplified with a modern Warehouse Management System (WMS) . Leading WMS platforms automate the cycle counting workflow, offering daily guidance to both individual counters and reviewers through user-friendly checklists and dashboards. Moreover, such software facilitates cycle counting using smartphones and other handheld devices, streamlining the process and enabling real-time updates to inventory figures. WMS solutions streamline the identification of disparities between expected and actual counts, prompting recounts as necessary, and facilitating adjustments to the general ledger. They transform what can be a lengthy and labor-intensive procedure into a straightforward and relatively low-effort task. By integrating intelligent cycle counting with a WMS, businesses can reduce costs, enhance customer service, optimize warehouse efficiency,",

    "text": "Reverse logistics refers to the reverse of the conventional flow in the supply chain, where products are transported from the end consumer back to the manufacturer. This facet of supply chain management encompasses various activities such as managing returns, refurbishing, recycling, and disposal. It plays a crucial role in handling product returns due to reasons like damage, seasonal inventory fluctuations, restocking, salvage, recalls, or excess inventory. What is Reverse Logistics? Reverse logistics is a category within supply chain management that involves the movement of goods from customers back to sellers or manufacturers. Following the receipt of a product by a customer, processes like returns or recycling necessitate the implementation of reverse logistics. Initiating from the end consumer, the reverse logistics process moves in the opposite direction through the supply chain, either from the distributor to the manufacturer or directly from the end consumer to the distributor. Additionally, reverse logistics encompasses procedures where the end consumer takes responsibility for the final disposal of the product, which may involve recycling, refurbishing, or resale. When is reverse logistics applied? Reverse logistics is utilized by organizations when products travel backward through the supply chain, returning from their destination to the seller and potentially even back to the suppliers. The primary objective is to either recover value from the product or appropriately dispose of it. Globally, returns contribute to an annual value of nearly a trillion dollars, a figure that has seen a notable increase with the expansion of e-commerce. The goals of reverse logistics encompass both the recovery of value and the establishment of repeat customer relationships. Compared to in-store purchases, where less than 10 are returned, online orders experience return rates of at least 30. Forward-thinking companies leverage reverse logistics not only to manage returns efficiently but also to cultivate customer loyalty, encourage repeat business, and mitigate losses associated with return processes. Reverse Logistics versus Conventional Logistics In traditional logistics, the flow of products begins with suppliers and progresses to a factory or distributor before reaching retailers and customers. Conversely, reverse logistics management initiates at the consumer level and, moving in the opposite direction, facilitates the return of products to any point within the supply chain. Well-designed supply chains are adaptable to changes and can accommodate various reverse logistics requirements. This reversal process allows products to be returned either one step back in the chain or directly to the original supplier. Additionally, returned products can be redirected to regular sales channels or discount outlets, such as liquidators. The Reverse Logistics Process Reverse logistics entails the movement of goods at least one step backward from the traditional endpoint of the supply chain. This procedure incorporates various plans and controls, with some companies opting to delegate this task to external entities. The reverse logistics process encompasses the management of product returns and the acquisition of excess goods and materials. It also involves handling leases and refurbishments. The specifics of reverse logistics vary across industries, with distinct economic incentives driving efforts to enhance reverse logistics management. For instance, in the beverage industry, the reverse logistics process focuses on the utilization of empty tap containers. Beverage production companies aim to reclaim the value of these containers by reusing them, necessitating meticulous planning of transportation, effective management of shipping loads, and container cleaning. In the construction sector, reverse logistics involves the transportation and recycling of salvaged materials to new sites. As the construction industry increasingly adopts sustainable practices to minimize waste, there exists an opportunity for cost savings through the implementation of reverse logistics. In the food industry, reverse logistics is responsible for the return of packaging materials",

As the construction industry increasingly adopts sustainable practices to minimize waste, there exists an opportunity for cost savings through the implementation of reverse logistics. In the food industry, reverse logistics is responsible for the return of packaging materials and pallets. Companies also grapple with managing rejected food shipments, which pose logistical challenges due to potential delays leading to food spoilage and concerns about tampering. To address these challenges, the Reverse Logistics Association is developing secure, quick, reliable, login (SQRL) codes on packaging to provide detailed product information. 5 Steps to Effective Reverse Logistics Handle the Return Initiate the return process when a customer expresses the intention to return a product. This step involves obtaining return authorization and assessing the products condition. It also includes tasks such as scheduling return shipments, approving refunds, and replacing defective items. Manage Returns Upon the arrival of a returned product at your facility or centralized processing center, conduct a thorough inspection and categorize it based on its return category. (Note With optimized reverse logistics, you should have predetermined destinations for products before their arrival.) Organize products into disposition options, including fixing, reselling as new, reselling as a return, recycling, scrapping, or refurbishing. Facilitate Continuous Movement of Returns Minimize daily waste by directing repairable items to the repair department. Repair After evaluating the returned item or equipment to determine repair feasibility, transfer it to the repair area. If repair is not feasible, sell any salvageable parts. Recycle Items or components that cannot be fixed, reused, or resold should be directed to the recycling area. The Elements of Reverse Logistics Various forms of reverse logistics center around the management of returns, return policies and procedures (RPP), and encompass aspects like remanufacturing, packaging, handling unsold goods, and addressing delivery issues. Additionally, other facets of reverse logistics pertain to leases, repairs, and product retirement. Returns Management This process involves the handling of product returns from customers or the proactive avoidance of returns. These activities should be characterized by speed, control, visibility, and simplicity. A company is often evaluated based on its efficiency in managing returns and the effectiveness of its return policies. Instances of re-returns, where an item is returned for the second time, are not uncommon. Such returns may trigger extended return policies, such as providing store credit. For example, a customer purchases a previously returned product at a clearance price, takes it home, and discovers it is broken. While the stores policy may not typically accept the return, it might allow for store credit for the defective product. Re-returns can also occur when a vendor rejects a return and returns it to the buyer without a refund, especially in the case of custom-made items. Return Policy and Procedure (RPP) The set of guidelines regarding product returns that a company communicates to its customers is referred to as its Return Policy and Procedure (RPP). It is essential for these policies to be transparent and consistent, with employees adhering to them. Remanufacturing or Refurbishment Another aspect of managing reverse logistics involves remanufacturing, refurbishing, and reconditioning. These activities focus on the repair, rebuilding, and reworking of products. Companies engage in the recovery of interchangeable, reusable parts or materials from other products, a process known as the cannibalization of",

These activities focus on the repair, rebuilding, and reworking of products. Companies engage in the recovery of interchangeable, reusable parts or materials from other products, a process known as the cannibalization of parts. Reconditioning entails disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling products. Packaging Management This form of reverse logistics centers on the reuse of packaging materials to minimize waste or disposal. Unsold Goods Reverse logistics for unsold goods addresses the return of products from retailers to manufacturers or distributors. Such returns may occur due to poor sales, inventory obsolescence, or refusal of delivery. End-of-Life (EOL) When a product reaches its End-of-Life (EOL), it is either no longer functional or no longer meets the customers needs, possibly replaced by a newer version. Manufacturers often opt to recycle or dispose of products that have reached their end-of-life, posing environmental challenges for both manufacturers and countries. Delivery Failure In cases of failed deliveries, drivers return products to sorting centers, which then send the products back to their origin. Although rare, some sorting centers may have the resources to identify the cause of delivery failure, rectify the issue, and resend the products. Rentals and Leasing Upon the conclusion of a lease or rental contract for a piece of equipment, the owning company can choose to remarket, recycle, or redeploy the product. Repairs and Maintenance In certain product agreements, customers and companies collaborate to maintain or repair equipment as needed. Some companies may sell repaired returned products to another consumer after addressing any damages. What are the Five Rs in Reverse Logistics? The five Rs in reverse logistics encompass returns, reselling, repairs, repackaging, and recycling. Companies employ metrics for each of these alternatives to monitor progress and success. Examining the five Rs can help your business streamline its reverse logistics processes and minimize losses. The significance of the five Rs in reverse logistics lies in maintaining an efficient flow of goods, reducing costs, adding value, mitigating risks, and completing the product life cycle. Businesses can benefit from a closer examination of these elements to enhance their reverse logistics operations. According to Gartner Research, approximately 70 of businesses intend to invest in the circular economy. This circular economy extends beyond traditional logistics and follows a closed-loop supply chain, as defined by Gartner. Circular Economy In the business context, reverse logistics plays a pivotal role by enhancing customer satisfaction through efficient returns management, cutting down on waste and costs through recycling and reusing materials, and bolstering brand reputation by showcasing environmental responsibility. This approach signifies a shift toward a sustainable economy, where companies actively engage in finding new purposes for discarded products through recovery, repair, and recycling, thereby assigning value to materials that were once considered mere waste. Participation in the circular economy also ensures compliance, as many countries implement policies compelling producers to adopt more sustainable practices. These guidelines encompass subsidies for waste prevention, research and development, and recycling initiatives. Furthermore, some policies impose restrictions on landfills, mandate the establishment of collection and recycling programs, and penalize certain wasteful practices.

How Does Reverse Logistics Add Value? Reverse logistics generates value by converting discarded items into sales and fostering customer trust. Businesses engage in the resale, reuse, and recycling of returned products. Moreover, efficient reverse logistics contributes to minimizing storage and distribution costs. According to Gartner Research, less than half of returned goods are resold at their original price, emphasizing the importance of determining the optimal disposition option for returned items. For instance, retail businesses like B-Stock specialize in reselling returned goods. B-Stock achieved sales of 70 million returned or excess goods in 2019 by purchasing returns at a percentage of their original cost and then selling them at a discounted rate to consumers. Leveraging reverse logistics to enhance the efficiency of the traditional supply chain benefits all stakeholders. Some businesses opt to separate their forward and reverse logistics, while others integrate them. The success of combining these logistics approaches depends on factors such as the companys expertise, the value of its products, and the volume of returns. Regardless of the chosen approach, businesses implement strategies to optimize profitability ratios in their supply chain activities. Explore expert tips on maximizing profits in business. Strategies for Enhancing Reverse Logistics Efficiency To enhance the efficiency of reverse logistics, companies must implement comprehensive strategies that prioritize speed, effectiveness, and cost considerations. When implementing these strategies, it is essential to focus on policies, partnerships, data utilization, capacity management, as well as logistics and transportation. Here are seven strategic approaches to optimize reverse logistics Assess Pertinent Policies and Agreements Thoroughly evaluate and update the procedures governing returns and repairs within your company. Ensure that these policies are transparent and address the root causes of returns and repairs. The way a company handles returns and repairs can serve as a competitive differentiator. Foster Collaboration with Suppliers Forge strong partnerships with suppliers to create a seamless, integrated experience for customers, avoiding a disjointed process that may be challenging for customers to navigate. Harness Data for Process Optimization Collect data on product returns to gain insights into the reasons behind customer returns. Utilize this information to make adjustments in sales strategies, product design, and forward logistics processes accordingly. Monitor Product Movements in Both Directions Establishing connections from raw materials to finished goods and customer orders enables effective tracking of ingredients. In the event of recalls, this approach allows for targeted recalls, pinpointing the specific issue instead of implementing recalls for entire product lines. Centralized Return Processing Centers The implementation of a centralized return center enhances the sorting and identification of products, enabling businesses to determine the most appropriate course of action for each item. If a dedicated return center is not feasible due to resource constraints, consider allocating a section of your warehouse or factory specifically for returns. Evaluate Logistics and Transportation Processes Regularly assess both forward and reverse logistics and transportation procedures. Explore the potential integration of certain processes and transit options. For instance, if delivery drivers can collect empty pallets while dropping off full ones, this can result in savings in terms of trips, time, and costs.

Reverse logistics presents a crucial opportunity for optimizing supply chain processes. Supply chain management encompasses both the forward and reverse flow of goods, and an influx of returns can lead to increased supply chain costs, negatively impacting profitability. Distinguishing Reverse Logistics from Reverse Supply Chain Reverse supply chain denotes the backward movement of goods, such as defective products, from vendors back up the supply chain. This concept contrasts with the conventional supply chain, where items progress from manufacturer to retailer to consumer. On the other hand, reverse logistics encompasses everything associated with product returns and the subsequent actions taken with those products after consumers return them. This includes planning and executing strategies to minimize costs and losses related to returns, ultimately enhancing the overall returns experience. Monitoring Reverse Logistics in Your Supply Chain Companies employ reverse logistics monitoring in the supply chain to explore more effective methods for handling and disposing of products. The intricate details regarding the movement of goods back and forth through the supply chain offer a wealth of information that assists companies in achieving their delivery objectives. While some organizations aim for straightforward on-time delivery, others strive for what they term the perfect order. This entails attaining a flawless score across various aspects for every order, including place, time, condition, package, quantity, documentation, customer satisfaction, and invoicing. Achieving the perfect order requires continuous monitoring of data, setting metric targets, and refining processes based on the obtained results. Reverse logistics emerges as a central player in the pursuit of delivering the perfect order. 5 Crucial Metrics for Monitoring Reverse Logistics in the Supply Chain There are five key metrics focused on reverse logistics within the supply chain that contribute to enhancing asset recovery. Utilizing supply chain analytics enables management to make informed, data-driven decisions at every stage of the supply chain. Key metrics in the supply chain Volume Tracking the volume of returned products and their subsequent resale, reuse, and recycling is a primary metric for monitoring reverse logistics. Utilizing these measurements helps companies identify missed opportunities or issues, enabling them to pinpoint areas for process improvements. Percent of Costs Evaluate the costs associated with resales, refurbishing, reuse, and recycling against the total supply chain cost. Analyze the discrepancy between the expenses incurred in these activities and the cost of returns. Calculate the percentage of expenses recovered per item. Condition of Returned Products Assess the condition of returned products, distinguishing between those suitable for immediate resale at full value and those requiring refurbishment before resale. For items needing work, explore alternative sales channels. For instance, consider selling refurbished electronics through different channels. Determine the cost of materials and labor to ascertain the full value. Examine the percentage of items directed to each sales channel and assess whether the company is recovering sufficient funds. Financial Value Recognize the economic value associated with each step",

Effective metrics contribute to revenue growth, improved profit margins, and prudent capital management. As supply chains increasingly embrace digital transformation, the process of collecting data becomes more streamlined. Explore the supply chain analytics guide to optimize the implementation of this practice. The Evolving Landscape of Reverse Logistics The future of reverse logistics revolves around minimizing disruptions caused by returns, a challenge particularly prominent in the growing realm of ecommerce and, to an increasing extent, in the retail sector. Companies can leverage reverse logistics to seamlessly integrate all aspects of the returns process. A strategic approach to integration involves linking the products data to the appropriate handling procedures for staff. By documenting the fate of a returned productwhether it is slated for resale, repairs, or repurposing for raw materialsthe supply chain can facilitate this cohesive integration. The future of reverse logistics envisions integrated supply chain management software capable of making these determinations and providing valuable reports. Effectively Manage Reverse Logistics with Warehouse Management Software Efficiently overseeing your reverse logistics is vital for the financial health and reputation of your business. Consumer trust hinges on the perception that they are purchasing products from companies with integrity. Enhancing your reverse logistics presents opportunities for implementing sustainable business practices. This underscores the critical importance of having a Warehouse Management System (WMS) capable of handling both inbound and outbound logistics while providing real-time analytics. Businesses require comprehensive insights spanning transportation and logistics providers, warehouse and fulfillment operations, and seamless integration of this information with financial data in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Coupling ERP platforms with a Warehouse Management System like PALMS Smart WMS enables companies to effortlessly track returns, monitor goods movement, process credits through the accounting system, and update customer records. Equally crucial is effective inventory management for efficient returns processes. A high rate of returns can lead to an accumulation of inventory, and a well-designed inventory management system will promptly alert you when inventory levels exceed the pace of sales. With increasing awareness that returns constitute a significant expense, many companies are closely examining their reverse logistics to identify opportunities for recovering more value from returned goods. Additionally, the surge in return rates underscores the urgency for businesses to find cost-effective methods for handling returned products. Evaluating reverse logistics processes to identify inefficiencies and rectify shortcomings not only reduces costs but also enhances customer loyalty and bolsters brand reputation, contributing positively to the bottom line. 30012024",

    "text": "30012024 In the realm of business, its a reality that not every product will experience swift sales. This is an inherent cost that every business must accept. When a company faces a situation where its inventory fails to sell and loses all market value for various reasons, it is required to recognize the loss through a process known as a write-off on its balance sheet and income statement. What is an Inventory Write-Off? An inventory write-off occurs when a company formally acknowledges that products initially intended for sale have depreciated to the point where they are no longer marketablerendered as dead stock or obsolete inventory. Several reasons may contribute to a companys inability to sell its entire inventory, including raw materials, parts, and finished goods. Obsolescence of some items can result from technological advancements, such as the introduction of faster equipment like computers or cell phones, or more sophisticated software. Additionally, changing fashion trends, as seen in clothing or home décor, can leave items unsold on shelves. Perishable goods reaching their expiration date or spoiling, as well as damaged, stolen, or lost items, are also ineligible for sale. Inventory is listed as an asset on a companys balance sheet. If it is determined that a certain inventory item will not be sold, the company decreases its gross inventory by the cost of the obsolete item. A corresponding expense of the same amount is recognized on the income statement. If the expense is minor, it can be included in the cost of goods sold. However, for more significant write-offs, it is recommended to treat them as a separate item rather than modifying the original entry. This approach facilitates loss tracking and minimizes the risk of distorting the gross margin. Write-offs have the effect of reducing a companys assets, consequently decreasing its overall value. Additionally, as a write-off incurs an expense, the companys profits experience a corresponding decrease (although certain write-offs may qualify for a tax deduction). Consider this scenario XYZ supermarket displays 20,000 worth of bread as inventory on its shelves, recognized as a 20,000 asset on its balance sheet. Suppose it needs to dispose of 2000 worth of bread due to it reaching the sell-by date yesterday. In response, the company records a 2000 write-off, diminishing the inventorys value to 18,000. Simultaneously, a 2000 expense is registered on the income statement, leading to a reduction in net income. Certain companies anticipate future write-offs by establishing an inventory reserve, which maintains a credit balance representing an estimated amount to offset potential write-offs, based on historical needs. In accounting terms, the inventory reserve serves as a contra asset account, reducing the gross inventorys value to determine the net inventory. When creating an inventory reserve on the balance sheet, an expense of an equivalent amount is also reported on the income statement. In the event of an actual inventory write-off, both the gross inventory and the inventory reserve are decreased by the write-off amount. In this case, no additional expense is incurred, as the cost was already expensed when the inventory reserve was established. The Difference between Inventory Write-Off and Inventory Write-Down A write-off is the outcome when the value of inventory reaches zero, rendering it devoid of any worth. On the other hand, a write-down occurs when the fair market value of inventory drops below the cost recorded on the balance sheet, but the item still holds a potential selling value above zero. The write-down amount is determined by subtracting the current market value of the inventory item from its cost. To address a write-down, a business reduces the inventory value by",

On the other hand, a write-down occurs when the fair market value of inventory drops below the cost recorded on the balance sheet, but the item still holds a potential selling value above zero. The write-down amount is determined by subtracting the current market value of the inventory item from its cost. To address a write-down, a business reduces the inventory value by the specified write-down amount. In the absence of an existing inventory reserve, an inventory write-down expense account is established and reflected on the income statement. It is crucial to acknowledge both inventory write-offs and write-downs promptly, without spreading the recognition over multiple years or quarters. Returning to the supermarket example, lets consider XYZ Supermarket, which buys a loaf of bread for 2 and sells it for 2.25. As the sell-by date approaches, the company puts the loaf on sale for 1.50. Consequently, it must write down its inventory by 50 cents the variance between the purchase cost and the sale price multiplied by the quantity of affected loaves. This proactive approach is preferable to the alternative of letting the bread expire, leading to a full 2 write-off for each loaf. 9 Ways to Reduce Inventory Write-Offs Write-offs have a direct impact on a companys net income and retained earnings. This underscores the importance for businesses to effectively manage their inventory, routinely assessing whether items have become obsolete or depreciated in value. The ultimate aim is to minimize the necessity for inventory write-offs. Here are nine strategies that can be employed to mitigate such instances Exercise caution in purchasing excess inventory Its common to be overly optimistic about future business prospects, leading to the overordering of inventory. Supply chain challenges may contribute to this phenomenon. Nevertheless, an abundance of inventory ties up capital and increases expenses if sales fall short of expectations. Conducting a comprehensive analysis of past sales, considering any changes that may impact future sales, is essential before making new orders. Factors such as shifts in the economy, customers financial health, and changes in tastes or trends should be taken into account. Review and adjust procurement strategies To minimize inventory write-offs, consider adopting a strategy of more frequent and smaller inventory orders. This recommendation is particularly crucial for perishable items but is applicable to anything that could eventually be replaced by a newer model or fall out of fashion. Opting for smaller order quantities also enables managers to respond swiftly to shifts in demand. Its essential to recognize that implementing smaller orders may entail additional costs due to changes in economies of scale. For instance, a business might lose eligibility for the same bulk discounts, resulting in higher costs per item. More frequent shipments can lead to increased expenses related to transportation and personnel. Additionally, in inflationary environments, items are likely to be more cost-effective when purchased today compared to a few months into the future. Verify inventory upon receipt Upon the arrival of inventory at the warehouse , ensure that all items ordered and paid for have been correctly delivered. Conduct a thorough examination of the items to identify any damage and promptly return any goods that have been compromised. Subsequently, managers should routinely compare their inventory records with the physical merchandise on hand. Safeguard inventory from damage Adopting proper storage practices, such as placing items in a dry location or on elevated shelves to prevent accidental damage,",

Subsequently, managers should routinely compare their inventory records with the physical merchandise on hand. Safeguard inventory from damage Adopting proper storage practices, such as placing items in a dry location or on elevated shelves to prevent accidental damage, can protect inventory from harm, making it sellable. Additionally, installing smoke detectors and potentially a fire sprinkler system is a prudent measure. Consider offering discounts on aging items Contemplate reducing the price of items that have lingered in inventory for an extended period it is preferable to sell an item at a discounted rate than not selling it at all. Another option is to present aged inventory items as complimentary gifts with a purchase, fostering customer satisfaction and loyalty. Recall the earlier example with bread. It was more advantageous for ABC Grocery to place the bread on sale for 1.50 than to maintain its regular price and risk it remaining unsold on the shelf until it expires. Selling the bread for 1.50 results in a 50-cent per loaf write-down, as opposed to a 2 per loaf write-off. Return items to the manufacturer or sell them to another business Explore the possibility of selling aging inventory back to the manufacturer or to another business. They may have demand from different customers or be open to purchasing it at a discounted rate. Sell items for their components Certain inventory items can be disassembled and sold for their individual parts or raw materials. For instance, old computers may contain valuable hard drives and memory chips that can be sold separately. Used cars also have components that can be sold independently. Additionally, items made of plastic or metals can be sold for scrap or recycled Establish an inventory reserve Examine previous years write-offs to estimate the appropriate amount for an inventory reserve, which serves as a buffer against future write-off expenses. The inventory reserve operates as a contra asset account, paired with gross inventory to determine net inventory on the balance sheet. Simultaneously, the corresponding expense is recognized on the companys income statement. Invest in software solutions The occurrence of inventory write-offs may indicate inadequate inventory management. This is where warehouse management software proves valuable, primarily by providing an accurate depiction of a companys inventory. Software simplifies the task of maintaining precise records regarding available stock, its location, and its duration in storage. Managers can leverage this information to make informed decisions about the frequency and quantity of orders and identify instances where write-offs are necessary. In addition to its core benefits, warehouse management software can automatically alert business managers when inventory items are approaching their sell-by dates. It also facilitates the creation and management of documentation required for tax purposes when inventory is liquidated, donated, or discarded. Furthermore, the software can pinpoint areas where write-offs occur frequently, enabling managers to identify and address underlying issues. Reduce Inventory Write-Offs with Warehouse Management Software Warehouse management software offers a comprehensive overview of a companys historical and current inventory data, aiding business managers in making informed ordering decisions and preventing overordering that might lead to write-offs.

    "text": "23112023 For businesses dealing with physical products, the recorded inventory often exceeds the actual on-hand inventory due to various reasons, collectively known as shrinkage. This discrepancy, whether caused by theft, fraud, manufacturing or shipping errors, spoilage, or other unfavorable factors, can lead to financial losses. Shrinkage not only impacts a companys profits but may also prompt the need for price hikes to compensate, potentially affecting customer retention. In essence, shrinkage is the difference between recorded and physically available inventory, representing a loss that spans industries and supply chain processes. Whether its shoplifted goods, recording mistakes, or insufficient supplier deliveries, shrinkage remains a significant concern affecting businesses bottom lines. What Is Shrinkage? Consider a scenario where a grocery store records 50 notebooks of a particular type, worth 100, only to discover 40 notebooks (80 worth) during a physical count, with none sold. The 20 value of the 10 missing notebooks is termed as shrinkage. These unsold notebooks might have been subject to shoplifting, incorrect recording by the receiving employee, or inadequate supply from the supplier. Its crucial to recognize that shrinkage is a significant concern in retail, extending beyond industry or supply chain sectors. Instances include material wastage during manufacturing and the spoilage of perishable items en route to a restaurant, both adversely impacting a companys profits. Shrinkage, sometimes known as shrink, is categorized as a business cost, and it is often overlooked as it accumulates gradually. Despite its seemingly small increments, it amounted to substantial losses, reaching 112.1 billion in 2022 for the retail sector alone, as reported by the National Retail Security Survey . Smaller businesses bear a more significant impact on profitability compared to larger counterparts. Given the inevitability of some shrinkage, businesses must define an acceptable loss threshold, a variable determined by industry and individual businesses. In the retail sector, the average shrink rate in 2022 was 1.6, according to the NRF study. However, expectations vary for instance, a furniture manufacturer anticipates less shrinkage than a bakery, mainly due to the perishable nature of bakery products. Moreover, shrinkage tolerance differs among bakeries, with one accepting a 5 shrinkage rate while another sets a 3 cap. Therefore, tracking shrinkage rates over time becomes crucial for businesses to establish norms. Businesses must also consider shrinkage when determining inventory orders. For instance, a furniture manufacturer fulfilling a 50-desk order may opt to order an additional 10 of mahogany to accommodate potential waste from cutting errors and wood imperfections. Why is it Important to Address Inventory Shrinkage? Each time inventory discrepancies arise, whether due to unknown reasons or identifiable causes, a business not only incurs the cost of the inventory itself but also forfeits potential profits from its sale. This situation may result in stockouts, leaving the business unable to meet demand and risking the loss of customers to competitors. The financial impact of shrinkage may lead a business to increase prices, potentially alienating customers. Additionally, addressing shrinkage may necessitate new expenses, such as investing in surveillance equipment and security personnel to combat shoplifting. Prudent businesses proactively account for shrinkage in their overall costs, incorporating it into budgeting and product ordering processes to mitigate the financial impact. This strategic approach ensures businesses are adequately prepared for inventory-related challenges. How to Calculate Inventory Shrinkage Determining inventory shrinkage involves simply deducting the physically counted inventory from the expected amount. This calculation parallels the assessment of financial loss, where the dollar value of the counted inventory is subtracted from the documented book value of the inventory. For instance, if a furniture store logs a shipment of 100 new desks valued at 25,000 but only",

How to Calculate Inventory Shrinkage Determining inventory shrinkage involves simply deducting the physically counted inventory from the expected amount. This calculation parallels the assessment of financial loss, where the dollar value of the counted inventory is subtracted from the documented book value of the inventory. For instance, if a furniture store logs a shipment of 100 new desks valued at 25,000 but only has 90 desks worth 22,500 on hand, the ten missing desks, valued at 2500, represent the shrinkage. To account for this loss, the business must create a journal entry recording the 2500 as an expense. Expressing inventory shrinkage as a percentage offers insights into patterns and trends over time, prompting consideration of procedural changes. To calculate the percentage of shrinkage, divide the total shrinkage by total sales. In the given example, divide 2,500 by the total inventory book value (25,000) and multiply by 100, resulting in an alarming 10 shrinkage. Inventory Shrinkage Formula Inventory shrinkage refers to the disparity between the recorded amount or value of inventory in a businesss accounting records (book inventoryvalue) and the actual amount or value in stock (actual inventoryvalue). The formula for computing the shrinkage value, as explained earlier, is Shrinkage Inventory book value inventory actual value Shrinkage 25,000 22,500 2,500 The same formula can be used to calculate inventory shrinkage for the number of units Shrinkage 100 90 10 units The formula for calculating the percentage of shrinkage again, using the previous example is Shrinkage percentage (Shrinkage value book value) x 100 Shrinkage percentage (2,500 25,000) x 100 10 Types of Shrinkage Shrinkage, categorized as an inventory carrying cost, poses a threat to a businesss profitability, affecting various industries and stages along the supply chain. The repercussions of shrinkage ripple through each link in the chain, leading to higher prices that are eventually borne by end customers. Manufacturer At the manufacturing stage, shrinkage can impede or cease production if, for instance, the manufacturer has fewer raw materials than indicated in its inventory records. The manufacturing process itself generates waste, known as spoilage, which cannot be repurposed. Shrinkage may also occur due to factors like termite damage in wood storage, posing a significant threat to manufacturers, such as the furniture manufacturer mentioned earlier. Vendor Consider the scenario where the furniture manufacturer fulfills an order for 50 office desks and ships them to the office furniture supplier. During transport, one desk is damaged, and another is mistakenly left behind. The supplier experiences a shrinkage of two desks. Subsequently, when fulfilling orders for 15 desks each for three companies, the supplier faces another instance of shrinkage, this time due to employee theft. This cycle repeats as shipments leave the suppliers premises. Retail In the retail sector, the average shrink rate in 2022 amounted to 1.6, equivalent to 112.1 billion, with organized crime being the primary cause, as per the 2023 NRF survey . Shoplifting and employee theft are major contributors to shrinkage, accompanied by errors in customer transactions, misuse of employee discounts, and administrative errors like pricing and inventory counting mistakes. Causes of Shrinkage Mitigating inventory shrinkage requires businesses to address its root causes, including TheftShoplifting Inventory theft, whether by employees internally or customers externally, is a pervasive challenge across the supply chain. In retail, theft constitutes 65.5 of shrinkage, with internal issues like point-of-sale exceptions, where employees manipulate discounts and engage in cash theft, and return",

In retail, theft constitutes 65.5 of shrinkage, with internal issues like point-of-sale exceptions, where employees manipulate discounts and engage in cash theft, and return fraud, involving stolen products or counterfeit transactions for refunds. Spoilage Businesses in the food service industry, such as food manufacturers, restaurants, bars, and grocery stores, face shrinkage due to expiration of food and beverages. Perishable items must be disposed of if not used or sold within a limited timeframe, and obsolescence occurs when trends change, rendering inventory outdated. Human ErrorAccidents Inevitable mistakes, from improperly packed products breaking during transit to bookkeeping errors in recording incoming inventory, cashier miscalculations, shopper-inflicted damages, or accidents like a waiter dropping a tray of food, accidents during freight shipping , contribute to shrinkage. The manual handling of tasks increases the likelihood of errors. Vendor Inaccuracy Vendor fraud introduces inaccuracies, whether through fraudulent vendors submitting fake invoices, legitimate vendors intentionally overbilling, or instances of double billing where an employee receives a second payment. These deceptive practices impact businesses and contribute to inventory shrinkage. Impacts of Shrinkage Shrinkage, a persistent, multibillion-dollar challenge, presents a variety of adverse outcomes Profit Loss Shrinkage amplifies a businesss cost of goods sold (COGS) and diminishes its profit margin. Reordering inventory to compensate for losses, coupled with missed sales opportunities due to insufficient stock, further erodes the bottom line. Escalating Expenses The repercussions of shrinkage extend to increased business costs, notably in replacing lost inventory. Efforts to address and rectify shrinkage causes also contribute to mounting expenses. For instance, a retail store combating shoplifting may invest in additional security cameras and technology, diminishing overall profit. Price Adjustments Some businesses opt to raise product prices to compensate for profit lost to shrinkage, effectively passing on these costs through the supply chain. However, this strategy carries risks, as it may drive customers to seek alternatives. Shrinkage Prevention While complete prevention of shrinkage is unattainable in inventory-centric businesses, it is feasible to manage and mitigate its impact on profits.

    "text": "23112023 Freight shipping serves as a method for businesses to move bulk shipments that go beyond the weight and size limitations of parcel packages. Typically, this type of cargo is packaged and transported on pallets. What is Freight?r The term freight can be used to refer to any cargo requiring transportation from one location to another, ineligible for parcel shipping commonly used in smaller packages. Criteria defining freight can vary by carrier, often including items weighing over 150 pounds, measuring more than 108 inches in length, or exceeding 160 inches in length plus girth (twice the sum of width and height). Goods transported on pallets are generally classified as freight. Freight can include a wide range of items, including large quantities of smaller goods consolidated on pallets. Examples of products often requiring freight delivery are furniture, automobiles, construction materials, and specific outdoor activity equipment. Common freight carriers exclude hazardous items like aerosols and fireworks, valuable products like jewels, and perishables such as meats and frozen foods, though there are specialized carriers available for these shipments. What is Freight Shipping? Freight shipping refers to the various transportation methods tailored for the movement of larger shipments across different locations, playing a pivotal role in global logistics networks. These methods may involve a combination of ships, planes, trains, and trucks. Consider a U.S.-based contributor sourcing most of its goods from Asia these goods are loaded into a shipping container, traversing the Pacific to a West Coast port. Subsequently, a truck or train transports them to their final destination, often arriving months after departure from an Asian port. In contrast to parcel shipments using delivery trucks like FedEx, UPS, or Amazon, familiar to us all, freight shipments involve sizable, heavy loads necessitating semi-trucks and other high-capacity transportation modes. Measurement of freight shipments typically revolves around the space they would occupy in a semi-truck trailer, categorized as full truckload or less than truckload (LTL). Although its uncommon for customer orders to be delivered via freight, it serves as the primary method for companies to receive and, in some cases, send goods, influencing both inbound and outbound logistics. Product-oriented businesses, requiring substantial quantities of parts, materials, and finished products, often opt for bulk orders. Even service organizations necessitate supplies for their offices and staff, often procured in large quantities. Freight shipping proves to be more cost-effective and efficient compared to dividing such cargo into smaller shipments handled by parcel services. The processes and equipment involved in moving large, heavy goods differ significantly from those for relatively small packages delivered swiftly to your doorstep by a delivery van. While companies like UPS and FedEx offer both parcel and freight services, these operate as distinct entities. Businesses should be aware of their options and the regulations of various carriers rather than defaulting to freight shipping with a familiar carrier. There might be viable alternatives, such as breaking down a smaller freight shipment into multiple smaller parcel shipments. Freight Shipping Modes There are many different kinds of freight shipping tailored to meet different business needs. Factors such as volume, type, and urgency of goods influence the choice of the most suitable mode. Shipping providers should offer quotes for different options, allowing businesses to select the option that aligns best with their needs. Less Than Truckload (LTL) For smaller freight shipments, LTL is a cost-effective choice, sharing trailer space with other businesses. Despite being slower due to additional stops and loadingunloading, it is suitable for shipments ranging from 150 to 15,000 pounds. Full Truckload Larger bulk shipments exceeding 15,000 pounds require a full truckload, offering faster transit without extra stops",

Full Truckload Larger bulk shipments exceeding 15,000 pounds require a full truckload, offering faster transit without extra stops or detours, reducing the risk of damage. Partial Truckload Similar to LTL, partial truckload involves sharing space with other shippers, but shipment sizes are typically larger (over 5,000 pounds). Sea Transport Shipping via ships is a globally popular method due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to cover long routes across continents. Approximately 80 of global goods shipped travel by sea at some point. Air Freight Planes provide the fastest but most expensive option for swift delivery, often reserved for rush orders or small, high-priority shipments. Rail Freight Trains offer a cost-effective means to move freight cargo, especially for non-time-sensitive shipments. Trains may transport goods to or from ports, connecting them to the final destination for last-mile delivery. Intermodal Combining multiple freight transportation methods, intermodal shipments can involve ground, air, and sea transport. While often cost-effective, it may take longer due to multiple modes. Expedited Ideal for tight timelines, expedited freight shipping ensures swift delivery using planes and trucks, albeit at a premium cost. Benefits of Freight Shipping Freight shipping stands out as one of the most prevalent global shipment methods for various reasons, particularly for the movement of large orders. Several key advantages highlight why freight shipping is widely favored Cost-Effective Freight shipping proves to be an economical choice for transporting large quantities of goods, especially when utilizing ships or trains. This is particularly noteworthy with Less Than Truckload (LTL), significantly reducing truck transportation costs, a crucial consideration amid escalating shipping expenses. Versatility in Load and Quantity Freight shipping can accommodate diverse loads, including numerous pallets and the heaviest, most unconventional packages. Few other methods rival the broad range of goods that freight can handle. Environmental Friendliness Consolidating shipments for multiple companies on ships, rail cars, and trucks optimizes each trip, curbing additional emissions-generating journeys. This aligns with the growing consumer focus on the environmental impact of the companies they support. Diverse Options Freight shipping not only accommodates various types of goods but also provides businesses with a range of choices concerning speed, costs, and shipment sizes. This extensive selection empowers shippers to choose the most suitable option for any given transport. Reliability Despite recent disruptions in supply chains affecting all shipping methods, freight remains a generally reliable means to move products, ensuring shipments reach their destinations by the promised date. This enhances on-time delivery and other key performance indicators (KPIs) , with even LTL shipments often adhering to regular schedules as carriers group regular customers from the same area and follow consistent timelines. Factors That Define Freight Shipping Rates If a company is uncertain about whether to opt for freight or parcel shipping, they can utilize online estimator tools provided by various carriers to estimate the cost. Generally, the primary factor influencing the overall price is the total shipping capacity consumed by the shipment. Several variables come into play that impact the cost of shipments Distance The total distance that the package needs to travel significantly affects the price.

Several variables come into play that impact the cost of shipments Distance The total distance that the package needs to travel significantly affects the price. For instance, a Trans-Pacific journey will incur higher costs compared to goods transported by train to a city 300 miles away. Timing Rush shipments with high priority will invariably cost more than slower-moving deliveries. The flexibility on the delivery date influences the overall cost, making it more economical with a less urgent timeline. Mode of Transport As previously mentioned, freight covers various transportation modes such as truck, rail, sea, and air. The chosen mode of transportation has a substantial impact on the price, with ocean shipping typically being the most cost-effective, followed by rail, truck, and air. Weight The weight of a shipment, whether its a 200-pound item or a 3000-pound collection of pallets, significantly influences prices. Heavier shipments are more challenging to move and occupy less capacity for other goods, leading to increased costs. Size The size of the items in your shipment, including whether they take up a small corner or a significant portion of the truck bed, plays a role in determining the cost. Larger items result in higher expenses. Location The pickup point for the shipment impacts rates in various ways. Proximity to the carriers nearest location and its proximity to pick up spots for other businesses joining the journey are factors influencing the price. Time of Year Weather-related challenges, such as unfriendly seas or snowy road closures, can be significant during certain times of the year, affecting costs associated with moving goods. DensityStowability The packability of items, including how well they fit into a shipping container or truck trailer, impacts the total load capacity and, consequently, factors into the overall price. When to Consider Multi-weight Instead of Freight Multi-weight is a tool that compares the cost of dividing a shipment into multiple packages, potentially utilizing parcel shipping for some or all items, versus consolidating everything into a single shipment. This tool proves beneficial when dealing with numerous boxes or pallets originating from the same location and destined for the same endpoint. Some tools automatically select the more cost-effective option based on the details you input about your packages. By assisting in the selection of the optimal option, multi-weight can reduce the landed costs of your shipments. Additionally, it eliminates the need for manual calculation of expenses associated with various options. Its important to note that not all shipments qualify for multi-weight, as there are minimum and maximum total weights and dimensions for each package and the entire shipment. When freight and multi-weight present similar pricing for a shipment, several other factors come into play. Multi-weight shipments do not require palletization or specific packing areas, and the pallet itself does not contribute to the shipment weight. Drop-off points for multi-weight shipments do not necessitate docks or lift-gates required for pallets. Furthermore, the use of multiple boxes enhances delivery in large cities that are challenging for larger boxes or semi-trucks to navigate. How to Ship Freight If youve concluded that freight is the optimal method for shipping your goods, the next step is to prepare your items for a freight carrier. Lets go through the necessary steps",

Furthermore, the use of multiple boxes enhances delivery in large cities that are challenging for larger boxes or semi-trucks to navigate. How to Ship Freight If youve concluded that freight is the optimal method for shipping your goods, the next step is to prepare your items for a freight carrier. Lets go through the necessary steps to ensure your goods are ready Assemble any required shipment documents for review by the carrier. Select a pallet, box, or crate of suitable size for the shipment, ensuring it is free from significant damage. Inspect the items for any issues, replacing damaged items or making notes of minor problems to track any damage caused during shipping. If using a pallet, arrange boxes or items in a consistent vertical pattern, ensuring nothing protrudes over the edges. Alternatively, load everything carefully into a box or crate, using padding or protective materials as needed. Generate labels containing the destination address and the contents of the pallet or box, including barcodes or unique identifiers. Attach these labels securely to the shipments. Use straps, bands, and shrink wrap to secure all contents to the pallet within a container. Move the packaged shipments to the designated area where the carrier will pick them up. Verify all pallets and packages for complete and accurate labels. Capture photographs of each pallet or package to document their condition before the carrier assumes possession. This documentation can be useful in case of any issues later on. Managing Freight and Commerce with Software Numerous companies have recently increased their investment in supply chain technology, recognizing its significant value to their operations. Supply chains represent a substantial portion of expenses for product-based businesses, making efficiency gains in this area highly impactful.

The majority of everyday products, such as soap, laptops, or dining tables, likely underwent freight shipment at some point in their journey to consumers. Despite being largely unnoticed by the general public, freight shipping is a critical method for transporting goods globally. Businesses involved in bulk shipments, whether sending or receiving , should possess a foundational understanding of freight shipping, considering its pivotal role in their supply chain. Beyond potentially reducing transportation costs, it often becomes the sole option for transporting large or heavy items. Having insight into the factors influencing freight shipment costs and access to appropriate tools empowers companies to maximize the benefits of freight shipping. Freight Shipping FAQs What can be transported via freight? Virtually any item can be transported via freight, except for hazardous (e.g., explosive products), perishable (e.g., produce), or highly valuable (e.g., precious gemstones) items. Even in these cases, specialized carriers exist to facilitate the transportation of such goods. However, shipments must meet minimum weight or size criteria to qualify for freight shipping, explaining the prevalence of pallets carrying numerous smaller goods. How can I determine the appropriate freight solution for my business? Selecting the optimal freight solution depends on your budget, shipment size, and required delivery date. Less than truckload (LTL) is a popular choice for smaller shipments, offering cost savings compared to a full truckload, albeit with a potentially slower delivery time. Intermodal freight shipping, employing multiple modes like air and train or sea and truck, significantly influences both the cost and delivery timeline based on the chosen methods. What distinguishes parcel from freight? Parcel shipping caters to smaller and lighter shipments, typically under 150 pounds and less than 108 inches long or 160 inches in length plus girth (twice the sum of width plus height). Items commonly delivered to doorsteps, such as electronics, shoes, and home improvement tools, typically use parcel shipping. Freight, on the other hand, is primarily employed by businesses to economically transport large quantities of goods globally, utilizing sea, truck, rail, and air transport. What is freight classification? Freight classification, established by the National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC), provides a framework for determining the pricing of less than truckload (LTL) shipments. The freight class is determined based on factors like density (weight relative to size), liability (value-based), handling requirements, and stowability. Ranging from 50 to 500, freight classes are assigned numerical values, with higher numbers indicating higher shipment costs.",

    "text": "08112023 Managing inventory poses a significant challenge for businesses with warehouses. As the quantity of items in storage increases, the task of monitoring them without the aid of an inventory list becomes increasingly difficult. Such a list not only helps in keeping tabs on possessions but also offers valuable insights into restocking timings, identifying stagnant products, and factors impacting a companys carrying costs and financial health. Like numerous other business processes that benefit from real-time data and automation, automating inventory lists can also help save a lot of time and effort. What is an Inventory List? An inventory list serves as a structured summary of all the products a business has in its inventory, including raw materials, components, work-in-progress items, and finished goods. It typically contains vital information, such as the items SKU number, name, description, unit cost, etc. An inventory list is indispensable for monitoring inventory performance, and turnover, and facilitating demand forecasting. What should be included in an Inventory List? The specific details to include in an inventory list depend on the nature of the business, the recording method, the volume of inventory, and the industry. However, some fundamental information should always be present. Its important to note that product variations, including differences in size, color, model, and make, should also be documented. Item name Stock-keeping unit (SKU), barcode, or serial number for item tracking Category and a concise item description Supplier or manufacturers name Sale price Unit cost Stock quantity Total value Reorder point Days per reorder Methods to Create an Inventory List Manual Inventory List Crafting an inventory list manually necessitates the physical counting of each item in stock. The collected data is then documented on a form or template that can either be customized or obtained from a pre-existing source. For utmost precision, its crucial to maintain a list that keeps pace with the frequency of inventory changes. Although feasible on a smaller scale, this method becomes progressively more labor-intensive and prone to errors as the inventorys size expands. Excel A step beyond manual inventory lists involves the use of tools like Excel and Google Sheets. These applications require manual data input, but they offer functionalities that streamline inventory management. Data is manually entered into designated columns. By incorporating a few behind-the-scenes formulas, modifying one field can trigger automatic recalculations in another. Warehouse Management Systems Manual inventory lists and spreadsheets often fall short for businesses dealing with substantial inventory volumes across multiple locations and sales channels. A warehouse management system (WMS) excels in generating and continuously updating inventory lists with exceptional precision in real-time. Through integration with barcode scanners, radio-frequency identification tags, and point-of-sale software, WMS software records and communicates inventory movements. This system allows for automated inventory counts, timely notifications for nearing reorder points, and the automated generation of reports that facilitate data-driven decision-making to optimize warehouse operations. The Significance of Inventory Lists Inventory lists offer a comprehensive snapshot of a businesss stock, its inventory turnover efficiency, the need for restocking low items, and conversely, the need to reduce excess inventory, possibly through discounts. A well-maintained inventory list ensures that the right products are available to meet customer demands, preventing potential losses to competitors. This, in turn, can bolster cash flow, sales revenue, and profitability. If a businesss inventory list becomes outdated or inaccurate, it faces the risk of stockouts, dead stock accumulation, higher carrying costs, and shrinkage-related losses. Furthermore, inventory lists empower businesses to make informed choices regarding purchasing and production, ultimately leading to enhanced profitability.

Furthermore, inventory lists empower businesses to make informed choices regarding purchasing and production, ultimately leading to enhanced profitability. Why your Inventory List should be Automated Expanding businesses, such as those in the retail sector or involved in manufacturing, where raw materials are transformed into finished products, can reap substantial benefits from automating their inventory lists. There are several compelling reasons why a business should automate its inventory management Saving Time and Effort Automation reduces or even eliminates the need for time-consuming manual data entry, calculations, and the continual updates required for a comprehensive inventory list. Enhanced Accuracy and Visibility Manual processes are prone to errors, which can have significant consequences, especially when managing large inventories across multiple locations. Automation ensures real-time accuracy. Effective Stock Control A highly accurate inventory list empowers a business to exercise precise control over its stock levels, facilitating timely replenishments and removal of slow-moving items, ultimately resulting in a well-optimized supply chain. Improved Inventory Turnover Inventory turnover can be defined as the time it takes for an item to be purchased, starting from the point it enters into the possession of the warehouse. An automated inventory list provides real-time data, allowing businesses to identify stagnant or surplus stock, enabling more efficient management of inventory turnover. Fast-selling items can be promptly replenished. Reduced Carrying Costs Unsold inventory not only impacts potential sales but also adds costs in terms of insurance, taxes and storage. Automated lists help in tracking and flagging slow-moving products to minimize these carrying costs. Enhanced Data Analysis and Reporting An automated inventory list offers valuable, accurate, and timely information, supporting data-driven decision-making for improved inventory-related strategies. Informed Forecasting and Budgeting Precise, real-time data assists businesses in planning for anticipated customer demand and optimizing resource allocation for procurement. Simplified Tax Preparation Accurate inventory data directly affects the cost of goods sold (COGS), which has implications for a companys gross profit, gross margin, and tax obligations. Automated inventory lists mean that accounting teams are always furnished with precise information. Increased Revenue and Profitability All the aforementioned benefits contribute to the ultimate benefit of enhanced revenue and profitability, starting with the foundation of an accurate inventory list. Example of an Inventory List Free Template Whether in digital or physical form, an inventory list is a dynamic document that requires continuous maintenance for maximum reliability. The more automated its upkeep, the more accurate the list becomes. Inventory encompasses various forms, including raw materials, works in progress, and finished goods. In its simplest form, an inventory list is structured as a grid, with each row containing an item and its specific details organized by columns. Column labels typically include the item name, SKU, unit price, and stock quantity. More advanced lists, often managed by automated software, are particularly beneficial for businesses with diverse inventory types and variations. For instance, lets consider a basic inventory list template for a fictional sports store called The Athlete Store. This list details all the equipment available in the stores inventory. Each item has a unique SKU, even for different variations like various-colored footballs.

    "text": "03112023 In the conventional approach to inventory management, retailers buy products from suppliers in advance and assume responsibility for unsold items. However, an alternative supply chain strategy transfers the burden of inventory costs from retailers to suppliers. This consignment inventory model involves the manufacturer, wholesaler, or supplier retaining ownership of the goods until the retailer successfully sells them to customers. In this scenario, the retailer pays the supplier only for the sold goods and can return any unsold items. This supply chain model is often adopted by retailers with limited financial resources, particularly for expensive, slow-moving products. It offers retailers protection against the risk of investing in items with uncertain customer demand, as they do not incur losses on unsold inventory. Simultaneously, it provides suppliers with greater control over the sales channels, pricing, and alignment with their brand identity. What is Consignment Inventory? Consignment inventory is a supply chain approach where a retailer displays products for sale, but the supplier retains ownership until a customer makes a purchase. Since the retailer doesnt purchase the inventory upfront, unsold items can be returned. This model is commonly used for items like seasonal products (e.g., holiday decorations) and perishables like produce. For instance, a supplier of Christmas decorations might agree with a large retail store to offer its products from October to December. The store doesnt pay for the decorations in advance payment only happens when customers buy the products during that period. In January, any unsold items are returned to the supplier. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) vs Consignment Vendor managed inventory (VMI) and consignment inventory are often conflated, however, this is a common misconception. With vendor-managed inventory (VMI), the supplier takes responsibility for managing the retailers stock levels. In some cases, it may include checking inventory levels manually and adjusting them whenever necessary in others, the retailer will send stock updates at predetermined intervals and the vendor restocks appropriately. Consignment inventory differs from this as the retailer retains responsibility for ensuring stock is at appropriate levels for their business. The Consignment Inventory Process In the consignment inventory management process, the supplier (consignor) negotiates terms with the retailer (consignee). The contract covers the item cost, shipping fees, return procedures, inventory management, deposit or commission requirements, and liability for lost or damaged products. Once both parties agree, the supplier delivers the inventory to the retailer, earning money only when items are sold. The retailers profit depends on the set prices. Unsold inventory can be returned to the supplier without penalties. How to Manage Consignment Inventory Effective management of consignment inventory is crucial for both suppliers and retailers to maintain tight control over their products. For organizations dealing with a mix of consigned and non-consigned items, inventory management can be a complex task. Some still rely on slow and unreliable spreadsheet or paper-based systems, hindering collaboration between vendors and retailers. Numerous warehouse management systems are available on the market, but not all are equipped to handle consignment inventory. Many organizations opt for robust software designed to enhance control over various inventory tasks. Ideally, these solutions should track inventory sent by the supplier to the retailer, signal when restocking is needed to prevent stockouts, and monitor what the supplier must replenish in their own stock. These features assist suppliers in purchasing the right products, reducing excess stock at retail sites, and saving on shipping costs.

The Pros and Cons of Consignment Inventory For Suppliers Pros Enhanced Visibility Consignment inventory software allows suppliers to reach new audiences through retail stores, generating revenue without the need for retail space or additional staff. Testing Opportunities Suppliers can test new products in different markets, evaluating their performance based on sales. Reduced Inventory Costs Storing large quantities of goods in warehouses can lead to reduced carrying costs by partnering with retail outlets. Cons Increased Costs Suppliers must consider expenses like shipping, storage, and potential damages to goods. Uncertain Sales Efforts Dependence on retailers for product promotion can make it challenging to gauge their commitment to selling the goods. Unpredictable Cash Flow Suppliers may experience delays or lower-than-expected payments, as their income depends on retailer sales. For Retailers Pros Low Financial Risk Retailers pay for products only when sold, avoiding capital loss on unsold inventory and enabling the introduction of new products without financial risk. Increased Sales Potential Consigned goods diversify inventory, potentially boosting sales and profits. Reduced Storage Needs Retailers can restock based on customer demand, avoiding special storage requirements and returning unsold products. Cons Risk of Damaged Inventory Holding consigned goods for an extended period increases the risk of damage, and retailers may be responsible for these costs, even if the items dont sell. Management Complexity Tracking consigned goods can sometimes lead to confusion and errors, prompting businesses to consider purchasing warehouse management solutions. Additional Costs Retailers may need to cover certain expenses until items are sold, such as securing products. Best Practices for Consignment Inventory Effectively managing consignment inventory can become a complex task without proper procedures in place. Suppliers and retailers should collaborate to establish a mutually beneficial contract and nurture a strong partnership. They should leverage suitable technology for their inventory requirements, diversify their sales avenues, and prioritize open communication. Here are some recommended practices for consignment inventory management Establish a Robust Contract The contract serves as the foundation for a successful consignment inventory arrangement. Both the supplier and retailer must have a clear understanding of the agreements terms, encompassing responsibilities for shipping, returns, payment timelines, and liability for damaged or lost items. For instance, a retail inventory management contract should specify how inventory counting and management occur, detail deposit or commission requirements, and outline efforts to sell the goods in good faith within a reasonable timeframe. Foster a Strong Business Relationship Cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship with your business partner is of utmost importance. Suppliers should strive for the success of their products, while retailers should exert considerable effort in promoting the suppliers products. The more both parties collaborate to present the right products to the right customers, the stronger the relationship and higher the sales. Utilize Appropriate Technology Conventional inventory software may not suffice for consignment inventory management. Specialized consignment management systems are needed to track goods and invoices accurately. Organizations should explore solutions that offer data analytics and provide visibility into inventory for both the supplier and retailer, thereby reducing data disparities between the two parties. Diversify Sales Channels Not all partnerships may thrive, making it essential to seek multiple consignment inventory management partners. This approach mitigates risks for both suppliers and retailers by providing alternative business options. Maintain Effective Communication Effective communication between",

Consignment Inventory Accounting In the realm of consignment inventory management accounting, both the supplier and the retailer are involved in tracking consignment sales. However, its essential to note that consigned goods are part of the suppliers inventory exclusively. Despite the retailer being responsible for selling these goods, they do not assume ownership. The retailers involvement in accounting occurs only at the point of sale, which reflects on the balance sheet. At that juncture, the revenue from the sale and the payment to the supplier are recorded.

FAQs What is a consignment warehouse? A consignment warehouse is a storage facility managed by the supplier to store goods, ensuring swift deliveries to retailers. What is a consignment stock contract? In a consignment stock agreement, the supplier dispatches a stock of goods to a retailer while retaining ownership until the retailer sells them. What is consigned inventory? Consigned inventory from a supplier occurs when one party (e.g., dealer, agent, distributor) holds inventory that remains the property of another party (e.g., manufacturer or primary contractor) based on mutual agreement. How do you record consigned goods? Consigned goods should be recorded in warehouse management systems explicitly designed to support it, or consignment inventory software. Do you include consignment in inventory? Goods held on consignment are incorporated into the suppliers inventory, not the retailers. What is an example of consignment inventory management? A shoe store might collaborate with a small designer to sell some of the designers products in-store. In this scenario, the retailer doesnt need to order the shoes themselves, and the designer manages the consignment stock.",

Additionally, it enhances customer service by providing precise tracking and delivery details, while offering insights into sales performance and inventory trends for informed decision-making. What factors should be considered when selecting compatible WMS and e-commerce solutions? When choosing the right WMS and e-commerce systems , you need to evaluate several aspects. These include assessing how well their features align with your business objectives, considering their scalability and flexibility to accommodate growth and changes, ensuring their security and reliability to protect your data and transactions, and examining their integration capabilities for efficient communication and information exchange. Modern warehouse management systems (WMS) platforms simplify shipping by directly integrating with shippers and carriers. This integration enables the seamless exchange of online orders, warehousing data, and transportation logistics information within a single system, ensuring successful order fulfillment. What is Integrated Shipping and How Does It Operate? Integrated shipping refers to the process of consolidating online e-commerce order details with both your warehouse management system and shipping carriers to streamline fulfillment workflows and expedite order processing. This contributes to business growth and boosts customer lifetime value (CLV) without the need for additional software in your technology stack. Heres an overview of an ideal integrated shipping process to illustrate how this concept functions Your online store or marketplace channel receives a customer order. Your integrated inventory management system, often a WMS, records the order and automatically locates the nearest warehouse with available stock based on the customers location, adhering to any specific shipping rules you have in place. Your warehouse then assembles the order, including packing items with labels, packing slips, return labels, etc., using data from your integrated shipperscarriers. Finally, the order is handed over to a transportation service provider, which may offer features like address validation for accuracy. If integrated with multiple carriers, the system selects the carrier with the best price, availability, and service according to your business rules to ensure on-time delivery. When executed correctly, integrated shipping eliminates manual errors, accelerates processes, and enhances cost savings. However, there are still best practices you can implement to optimize this fulfillment strategy.

When executed correctly, integrated shipping eliminates manual errors, accelerates processes, and enhances cost savings. However, there are still best practices you can implement to optimize this fulfillment strategy. E-Commerce and WMS Integrations Methods and Best Practices Lets examine the most common configuration for warehouse integrations and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. A fast, dependable, and repeatable integration process can be created by combining these methods. Webhooks Webhooks represent the prevalent method of integration. Many warehouses support webhooks because they are swift and require minimal resources for operation and integration. The fundamental concept behind webhooks integration involves one application notifying another about any changes in its state, enabling other applications to take specific actions based on the webhook input. Consider this example An online store receives a customer order, such as a watch, from a warehouse in another location. The online store initiates a webhook integration by sending a request to the warehouse, providing information about the purchased product and the customers shipping details. Alongside customer information, the online store includes a callback URL and an action type (e.g., orderidship and action shipment_started) to trigger the callback URL. The warehouse prepares and ships the watch the customer purchased, even triggering the shipment_started event. Subsequently, the warehouse notifies the online store of this event by sending a signal via the provided callback URL, completing a simple webhook integration. As demonstrated in the example, webhooks offer a straightforward means to integrate different applications and transmit signals without delay. However, like any system, they come with their own set of pros and cons, which well explore next. Pros Close to real-time execution Webhooks enable signals to be transmitted promptly when events occur. Simple design The described integration approach is straightforward and reliable, as long as all parties understand how to handle each event. Cons Reliability Webhooks integration relies on all parties being online continuously, as online store purchases can occur at any time. If one party is unavailable to accept a signal, it is lost and cannot be automatically retrieved. Regression issues Changes made by one party without notifying the other (e.g., online store or warehouse) can disrupt integration, intentionally or unintentionally, leading to a breakdown in the entire process. Crons Another common integration method involves setting up cron jobs for specific tasks. Some warehouse integrations do not support webhooks, necessitating the execution of operations at predefined times. Consider the same example The online store, selling watches delivered by a warehouse in another location, records information about purchases and customer shipping details internally. At specific intervals, a cron job initiates and checks for new orders in the system that have not yet been synchronized with the warehouse. When a new unsynchronized order is found, the cron job sends a request to the warehouse with customer purchase orders and shipping information. The online store maintains a record of the order being synchronized with the warehouse for tracking order delivery initiation. Another cron job, at predefined intervals, checks all synchronized orders to determine which have been delivered and updates the internal order delivery status. When delivery commences, the online store informs the customer of the delivery status, typically including tracking information. In this example, integration using cron jobs involves more steps and extensive order tracking compared to webhooks integration. However, it",

When delivery commences, the online store informs the customer of the delivery status, typically including tracking information. In this example, integration using cron jobs involves more steps and extensive order tracking compared to webhooks integration. However, it offers its own advantages, which well explore next. Pros Reliability Cron jobs are highly reliable as they consistently follow the same predefined scenario with each execution. Even if the warehouse was offline previously and unable to accept new orders, it can resynchronize orders now. Distinctness Each cron job is dedicated to a specific taskeither sending orders to the warehouse or updating delivered order statuses. This simplicity makes the code easy to reuse and debug when necessary. Cons Resource usage Cron jobs for simple operations can consume substantial resources. Running a cron job frequently, such as every minute, to match the real-time speed of webhooks integration may result in most of the time being spent on looping over orders and checking statuses, loading resources for little change. Waiting time To optimize resource usage, cron jobs may need to run less frequently, causing longer waiting times for results compared to webhooks. Both webhooks and cron jobs offer distinct advantages and disadvantages in warehouse integration. Choosing the most suitable method depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your integration project. Integration Best Practices Best Practice 1 Implement Integration with Multiple Carriers and Shippers While you might be inclined to stick with a single shipping service or carrier, especially if you have an established relationship with them, it is highly advisable to integrate with multiple providers. This approach is key to achieving cost-effective and speedy order fulfillment. By integrating with multiple shipping carriers, you not only diversify the range of services you can offer but also reduce the overall expenses associated with last-mile delivery. Integrating with multiple shippers ensures that you have various rate options at your disposal and a reliable geographic coverage. Think of it this way having access to multiple shipping networks and carriers enhances your fulfillment capabilities, ultimately improving the speed at which you can process orders. This, in turn, leads to enhanced customer and client satisfaction. Best Practice 2 Customize Your Automation Rules In the realm of high-efficiency warehouse processes, your approach to integrated shipping should be tailored to align with your specific operational requirements, driven by automation. While streamlining the exchange of shipping information between your warehouse, carriers, and e-commerce channels through shipping integrations is crucial, the success of these integrations heavily relies on how your Warehouse Management System (WMS) is configured. In essence, ensure that your WMS is equipped with all the necessary automation rules to optimize the outcomes of your shipping integrations. Assign unique identifiers to specific orders or automatically designate a particular carrier or service type based on predefined criteria. This way, when an e-commerce order comes in, your fulfillment processes and carrier selections can proceed seamlessly, eliminating the need for manual decision-making. Heres an example If a customer qualifies as a VIP member of your e-commerce store due to membership or long-term loyalty, your system should automatically recognize this and apply free shipping or a reduced rate with a more premium carrier when their order is placed.

What is the average number of line items and units per order? How complex are the packing, labeling and shipping processes? Another important consideration is the current workflows of inbound, outbound and storage processes in the warehouse. Potential bottlenecks can be identified through this exercise, and standard operating procedure can be established. In order to reach this conclusion, you must ask yourself the following questions What is the current receiving process and how are quality checks conducted? How is the putaway of pellets, boxes and units achieved and what are the movement patterns? How is the putaway location decided? How are lot numbers and bin numbers tracked to comply with FIFOFEFO? Is there a real-time view of each products placement and the SKUs? What are the standard picking, packing, sorting and shipping processes? Evaluate the distinct needs and prerequisites of your clients that you must consider within your procedures and workflows. This might encompass a range of factors, including specialized handling and supplementary services. Are there any specific demands from the clients concerning the treatment of their merchandise? Should the clients products be placed in particular environments, like refrigerated or dry storage, or ambient storage, etc.? Do you provide your clients with value-added services like packaging, grouping, assembly, inspection, etc.? What type of reporting commitment have you made to each client? This includes up-to-the-minuteperiodic reporting for inventory, orders, returns, operational efficiency, and warehouse accuracy metrics. What SLAs (Service Level Agreements) have been assured to the client? These could involve one-daytwo-day order fulfillment, and so forth. From the preceding exercise, youve gained a comprehensive grasp of your clientele, their expectations from your fulfillment enterprise, and the necessary strategies for setting up and executing fulfillment operations that align with these expectations. Establishing Goals for the Warehouse Management System (WMS) This stage is pivotal in the selection, deployment, and customization of the appropriate WMS to suit your distinct prerequisites. These objectives often stem from the prior two exercisespain point identification and business environment analysis. Ideally, the WMS should alleviate the pain points and facilitate the execution of unique fulfillment operations tailored to your specific business. These objectives can encompass both qualitative and quantitative aspects and should clearly articulate the ultimate outcomes your fulfillment enterprise aims to attain. They need to be quantifiable and should be communicated to potential providers during the WMS assessment phase. Meanwhile, it is equally crucial to distinctly define the metrics that the WMS is intended to influence and how these metrics impact the overall vitality and performance of the company. Several common metrics that fulfillment enterprises aim to enhance through a contemporary WMS implementation include Warehouse throughput Order fulfillment rate Dailyweeklymonthly order processing volumes Order lead time Reduction in labor costs Net profit margins per fulfilled order What do you need to look for in a WMS for e-commerce? The following WMS features are particularly suited to e-commerce businesses Integration with ecommerce marketplace A warehouse management system offers the capabilities to integrate with the ecommerce store and update product catalogs, dispatch information, order status tracking, and stock levels.

API integrations allows orders from the ecommerce store to show up directly in the WMS application. Control Incoming Goods With a mobile application that displays which supplier or production line is about to deliver, and in what quantity, staff can stay informed and verify the quantity and quality of the product. Initiating the warehousing process or sending back the product can be done as quickly as possible. Multi-country Ecommerce orders can come in from any location around the world. The application must be able to support a variety of units and foreign currencies. Shipping documentation for exporting is a complicated matter and the WMS must be able to handle that too. Scalability As an ecommerce business that is continually growing, choosing a WMS that can grow with your business is incredibly important. The platform must be able to handle multiple warehouses, with modules for a variety of operational scenarios. It must be able to scale up or down based on demand fluctuations and accommodate changes in warehouse layout, processes, and product lines. Returns Management Handling returns can be complex. An ecommerce WMS streamlines the process by identifying the best disposition for returned items, whether restocking, repackaging, or disposing. Losses can be minimized and the return-to-stock cycle is sped up. Cross-Docking and Transloading An ecommerce WMS facilitates seamless cross-docking and transloading operations by coordinating the movement of goods directly from inbound to outbound trucks. The objectives of cross-docking can be pursued in a more streamlined manner like reducing handling and storage time, and speeding up the distribution process. Data Reporting In order to actually be useful, efficiencies need to be observable and quantifiable. An effective module will showcase not only a graphical overview of the primary metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs), but also offer a base level capacity to define the metrics you want, and also input or derive values necessary for accurately populating the data. Smart Put Away Techniques The ability to establish regulations for storage allocation, taking into account factors like popularity in terms of picking frequency, seasonal demand, storage unit attributes, dimensions, and volume is essential. There are instances when it is crucial to maintain a significant distance between items with distinct attributes, like food items, to mitigate the potential for allergen cross-contamination. Ecommerce WMS Best Practices As your business grows, there are a number of challenges in regards to ecommerce warehousing that you may encounter Your first storage space may become too small to match demand Safety stock might exceed needs, and you may need an overflow location specifically to store it Warehouse leasing or purchasing land Investment in fulfillment infrastructure like shipping supplies, conveyors, forklifts, technology, certifications and staff Need for multichannel inventory management due to new sales channels Need for secondary fulfillment centers to reduce shipping costs and transit times Scaling international fulfillment capabilities To ensure that these challenges are tackled in a meticulous manner, and to maximize business efficiency and customer experience, some best practices must be followed Test multiple picking systems to find the perfect fit There are a wide variety of picking methods that ecommerce businesses",

Advanced tools suited to ecommerce warehousing can auto-generate picking lists based on the ordered items proximity to one another, and enable batch picking to reduce the walking paths and time it takes to pick an order. Make a decision if this might be the best picking system, or if other systems can offer improvements. Set minimum points for inventory One of the biggest inventory management challenges is finding the right balance. When its too much, profits can be harmed and cause high inventory carrying costs, while not enough can affect customer retention numbers with out-of-stock notices in case demand spikes. Thus a smart precaution in inventory management is setting inventory minimums a good WMS will let businesses set reorder points, so they can receive a notification once a product reaches a specific threshold. Distribute the inventory Using the strategy of distributing inventory across multiple warehouses, shipping costs can be reduced. When an order is placed, it can be prepared and dispatched automatically from the distribution center closest to the customer. This translates to faster, more cost-efficient delivery, improving the customer experience. Utilize the WMS features An ecommerce WMS is a software specialized for ecommerce warehousing.

    "text": "19062023 SaaS (Software as a Service) and on-premise models are two of the most widespread implementation options for Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). While both models aim to streamline warehouse operations, they differ in terms of deployment, maintenance, cost, and scalability. Businesses need to have a comprehensive understanding of each model before making a choice. There are several key questions that they must ask themselves to ensure they make the right decision for their specific needs. Video Differences between SaaS and On-Premise Model SaaS WMS Model SaaS WMS, also known as cloud-based WMS , involves the deployment of software on the cloud, where it is managed and maintained by a third-party service provider. Businesses access the software via the internet, usually through web browsers or dedicated mobile apps. Here are some key characteristics of the SaaS model Deployment The SaaS model requires minimal infrastructure setup. Since the software is hosted in the cloud, businesses dont need to invest in server hardware. Basic infrastructure like wifi devices, laptops, barcode label printers and handheld devices, and network connectivity are all that are needed for the SaaS model. The system can be started quickly, with minimal IT expertise required. Maintenance and Updates The service provider is responsible for maintaining the software, including upgrades and updates. Businesses benefit from automatic updates without any additional effort or cost on their part. This ensures that they always have access to the latest features and improvements. Cost Structure Many firms that offer the SaaS model work on a subscription-based pricing model. Businesses pay a regular fee, usually monthly or annually, based on factors such as the number of users, volume of transactions, or warehouse size. This model eliminates the need for large upfront investments. Scalability The flexibility to scale as required and accommodate any changing business needs is the biggest reason to go for the SaaS model. As the business grows or experiences fluctuations in demand, it is easier to scale the system up or down. Additional users, warehouse locations, or features can be added seamlessly, as the infrastructure is managed by the service provider. Accessibility and Mobility One of the key advantages of the SaaS model is its accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection. Users can access the system from different devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, or smartphones. This mobility enables real-time visibility and control over warehouse operations, even when on the go. Disaster Recovery The service provider typically handles the backup and disaster recovery plans for the SaaS model in preparation for extenuating circumstances that could cause server damage or loss of data. The scope of these plans encompasses all kinds of technological disasters. On-Premise WMS Model On-premise WMS involves the installation of software directly on the businesss own servers or hardware infrastructure. The system is managed and maintained internally by the businesss IT team. The major characteristics of the on-premise model are Deployment The on-premise model requires businesses to invest in server hardware, network infrastructure, and IT expertise. The software is installed and configured on the companys servers, which are usually located on-site. This deployment model gives businesses complete control over the WMS environment. Maintenance and Updates The responsibility of maintaining and updating the software is on the business. This includes tasks such as installing patches, performing upgrades, and ensuring compatibility with other systems. These maintenance activities require time and resources. Cost Structure There are many upfront costs involved in the on-premises model, for purchasing hardware, licenses, and implementation services. Additionally, businesses bear the responsibility of ongoing maintenance, support, and updates. The total cost of ownership (TCO) over the systems lifespan is",

Cost Structure There are many upfront costs involved in the on-premises model, for purchasing hardware, licenses, and implementation services. Additionally, businesses bear the responsibility of ongoing maintenance, support, and updates. The total cost of ownership (TCO) over the systems lifespan is typically higher compared to the SaaS model. Scalability Scalability in the on-premise model will require additional investment in hardware and infrastructure. Upgrading servers, expanding storage capacity, or increasing network capabilities may be necessary as the business grows or experiences increase demand. Scaling the system can be a complex and time-consuming process, potentially leading to downtime during upgrades. Control and Security The on-premise model provides businesses with greater control and data security. Since the system resides on the companys servers, they have direct access and can enforce their own security protocols. This may be particularly important for businesses that handle sensitive or regulated data and require strict control over their IT environment. Disaster Recovery With on-premises deployment, the business is responsible for setting up a backup and disaster recovery plan in case of extenuating circumstances that can damage the servers or cause data to be lost. This can add to the expenses of the on-premises model, on top of the costs of setting up the infrastructure. The infrastructure setup for the on-premise model includes Hardware Production Servers Test Servers Report Servers External Storage Devices Backup devices for disaster management and mitigation Software Operating Systems and related licenses Database Management Systems and related licenses Report server licenses Anti-virus licenses Firewall licenses Load balancers Infrastructure for the data center like A secure area with access control mechanism for the servers Provision and backup for Maintaining a pre-set temperature Power backup for the data center Backup lines for both intranet and internet connections Provision for VPN Anti-static and fire-retardant flooring The Differences between SaaS WMS and On-premises WMS For better understanding, we have created a tabular summary of the differences between SaaS WMS and On-premises WMS Feature SaaS WMS On-premise WMS Deployment Cloud-based, accessed via the internet Locally hosted on the companys servers, and accessed through intranet or internet Server Management Managed by the SaaS provider Managed by the companys IT department Server Software Updates Automatically updated by the provider Manually updated by the company Scalability Easily scalable, resources can be adjusted Requires additional hardware for scaling Upfront Costs Lower upfront costs, subscription-based Higher upfront costs, perpetual licensing Server Maintenance and Support Handled by the SaaS provider Handled by the companys IT department Data Security Rely on the SaaS providers security measures Company has direct control over data security Technical Expertise Required Minimal technical expertise required Requires in-house IT expertise for maintenance and upgrades Disaster Recovery Provider typically handles disaster recovery Company responsible for its own disaster recovery plan Before choosing the deployment model, ask yourself these questions What are the budget and financial situation?

    "text": "12062023 Just-in-time inventory management, just-in-time manufacturing, kaizen, continuous improvement, and lean are buzzwords that one tends to hear a lot in the supply chain world. Many of these terms tie into emerging concepts of manufacturing and inventory management to boost profitability. The demands of todays competitive economic landscape are much higher than before, and businesses have to adapt to keep up. In this article, we will be taking an in-depth look at just-in-time inventory management. What is Just-in-Time Inventory Management? Just-in-time (JIT) inventory management is an inventory control system that aims to deliver materials or components to the production line precisely when they are required. It is based on the principle of producing and delivering goods or services in response to customer demand, rather than stockpiling excess inventory. The primary objective of JIT is the increased focus on eliminating waste, reducing lead times, and optimizing the flow of materials throughout the supply chain. This results in enhancing operational efficiency, minimizing costs, and improving customer satisfaction. An essential element of just-in-time is having long-term contracts with reliable suppliers. All the parts of the system are intricately interconnected and mutually dependent for successful operation. Steps in the Cycle of Continuous Improvement for Just-in-Time Inventory Every business that implements just-in-time inventory management, though varying in implementation, follows a general pattern of JIT procedures to achieve the results. Design The ideation of foundational processes happens at this stage. These include product design, manufacturing planning, process design, and personnel. Manage Continuous improvement is central to the process of JIT . At this stage, management defines the job roles of employees, sets parameters for quality control, and looks at load and capacity levels and schedules. Pull Keeping the team informed on the methods of production and withdrawal using Kanban or similar signaling methods, reviewing policies on lot sizes, and aiming to reduce wastage. Establish At this stage, the business should look over vendor relationships, contract negotiations, lead times, delivery expectations, preferred suppliers, and usage metrics. Fine-tune Reducing inventory movement as much as possible and determining the policies and controls on inventory. Build Detailing the skills required to make the process work and educating employees accordingly Refine Reducing the steps in production by refining the processes. Review Defining the metrics of quality and analyzing problem areas to identify root causes of problems. Tracking trends and improving on each aspect of JIT. The Continuous Improvement Cycle Techniques Involved in Just-in-Time Inventory There are several techniques and strategies involved in just-in-time inventory management methodology. For example, focused activities like paying attention to minute details, smaller lot sizes, increased transparency, optimized organization and a pull as opposed to a push approach are all facets of the lean method of operation, and essential parts for running a successful just-in-time inventory management warehouse.

Risk Management Developing contingency plans for supply chain disruptions Building alternative supplier relationships Implementing buffer stock strategies for critical components X. Technological Integration Utilizing inventory management software and systems Automating processes and data collection Employing advanced analytics for demand forecasting and inventory optimization A terminology frequently used in just-in-time inventory management is the Japanese Kanban, meaning sign or visual board. This concept is central to JIT. What is Kanban and why is it crucial for lean JIT inventory? Kanban can be defined as the CPU of the entire JIT operations, where work-in-progress and inventory movement is controlled. It is critical for eliminating the waste that results from overproduction. Traditional mass production systems use the push method and produce according to the forecasted sales. The Kanban system allows for greater flexibility on the production floor since production is based on actual orders. The production progress on the factory floor is tracked using cards (digital or paper). Kanban cards reflect the movement of inventory through the production process and can signal when its time to order more stock. Example of a Kanban Board The Benefits of Just-in-Time Inventory Management Reduced Inventory Costs JIT enables businesses to minimize holding and storage costs associated with excess inventory. By ordering and producing materials only when needed, companies can significantly reduce inventory levels, freeing up capital for other investments. Lower inventory levels also result in reduced warehouse space requirements, leading to potential cost savings. Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity JIT encourages a smooth and continuous flow of materials, ensuring that production processes are not interrupted by inventory shortages or excesses. This streamlined approach helps in identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies, enabling timely adjustments and process improvements. JIT also fosters a culture of continuous improvement, as any waste or inefficiency is immediately noticeable and can be addressed promptly. Improved Quality Control With JIT, materials are received just in time for production, reducing the chances of inventory becoming obsolete or damaged over time. By maintaining lower inventory levels, businesses can focus on ensuring the quality and integrity of the incoming materials, reducing the risk of defects or spoilage. JIT facilitates the implementation of rigorous quality control measures, as there is a greater emphasis on inspection and monitoring of incoming supplies. Faster Response to Customer Demand JIT allows businesses to be more responsive to changing customer demands and market trends. With a reduced lead time for ordering and production, companies can quickly adapt to shifts in customer preferences or market conditions. This agility in response to customer demand can lead to improved customer satisfaction and increased market competitiveness.

This agility in response to customer demand can lead to improved customer satisfaction and increased market competitiveness. Disadvantages of JIT Inventory Management The JIT philosophy depends on the diligence of everyone involved in the ecosystem to perform their duties in a timely and cohesive manner. The moment any part of this structure begins to sway, the whole infrastructure is jeopardized. Several risks could endanger the seamless functioning of a JIT inventory management system Lack of Preparation Since the entire workflow of the business needs to convert to lean management, being prepared is essential. It means that all procedures and practices of the firm need to accommodate the lean methodology. Missed opportunities Since JIT means that there are few or no finished goods available on hand, large or unexpected orders can become huge missed opportunities. Order Issues Stockouts and shortages can disrupt the entire system. Undisciplined employees If every team member is not on board with the idea of JIT and does not perform their due diligence, the quality of goods and productivity can be affected. Natural Disasters Acts of nature that are out of our control can interfere with the flow of goods and inhibit the production process. Supplier inconsistencies If there are issues with suppliers like untimely delivery or inaccurate amounts, then the entire production process can be disrupted. History of JIT Just-in-time inventory management emerged in the 1970s, closely intertwined with the development of the Toyota Production System (TPS), which served as its foundation. The origins of JIT can be traced back to post-World War II Japan . Japan faced significant economic challenges during this period and needed to find innovative ways to rebuild its industries. The Toyota Motor Corporation , under the leadership of Taiichi Ohno and Eiji Toyoda , recognized the need for a more efficient production system to compete with international manufacturers. Toyota Production Floor in the 1960s In the 1950s, Toyota began to explore alternatives to traditional mass production systems, which involved large inventories and long lead times. The company studied the production methods of American supermarkets, where goods were restocked based on actual customer demand rather than anticipated demand. This observation inspired Toyota to develop a production system that aligned manufacturing with customer requirements while minimizing overproduction. The Toyota Production System , better known as Lean Manufacturing, focuses on eliminating different types of wastages, like excess inventory. It focused on achieving a smooth, continuous flow of materials and information throughout the production process. The core idea behind JIT was to produce and deliver items just in time to meet customer demand, thereby reducing inventory levels and associated costs. JIT gained international recognition and popularity in the 1980s. JIT principles, including just-in-time delivery, vendor-managed inventory, and continuous improvement, were applied to a wide range of industries beyond automotive manufacturing. Over time, the concept of JIT has evolved and adapted to changing business environments. New technologies and digital solutions have enabled more accurate demand forecasting, improved supply chain visibility, and enhanced collaboration between supply chain partners. Additionally, concepts like lean manufacturing and Six Sigma have been integrated with JIT to achieve further efficiencies and quality improvements.

Automotive Industry The automotive sector is one of the pioneers in implementing JIT-based inventory management. Companies like Toyota, Honda, and Ford have successfully embraced JIT principles to streamline their supply chains and improve production efficiency. By maintaining minimal inventory levels and relying on timely deliveries, these companies have reduced costs and responded quickly to changing market dynamics. Electronics Industry In the fast-paced electronics industry, companies face rapid technological advancements and shorter product life cycles. JIT-based inventory management helps them adapt to these challenges effectively. Apple, Samsung, and Sony have been known to implement JIT techniques. In the case of Apple, they have one central warehouse located in the USA and about 150 suppliers around the world. They have robust and strategic relationships with all their vendors. Outsourcing production contributed to making Apple leaner, with most inventory in retail outlets and very little overstock. Retail Industry Retailers, both traditional and e-commerce, have recognized the advantages of JIT inventory management. Companies like Walmart, Amazon, and Zara have successfully employed JIT. Amazon implements a variation of JIT by setting up dedicated spaces inside the warehouses of their major suppliers. Inside the Pennsylvania warehouse of Procter Gamble (PG), Amazon has a fenced-off area where PG can simply move pallets. Employees from Amazon package, label and ship those directly to consumers. Since this facility is very close to PGs largest manufacturing plant and close to many major cities in the US and Canada, Amazon can meet its 24-hour delivery period on the personal care products of PG. Pharmaceutical Industry The pharmaceutical sector has unique inventory management requirements due to product expiration dates, stringent regulations, and varying demand patterns. JIT-based inventory management helps pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Johnson Johnson, and Novartis in minimizing inventory holding costs, avoiding product obsolescence, and ensuring the timely availability of critical medicines. Food and Beverage Industry Freshness and quality are crucial in the food and beverage industry. JIT-based inventory management enables companies in this sector to reduce food waste, manage perishable items efficiently, and maintain optimal inventory levels, sometimes using techniques like consignment inventory . Fast-food chains like McDonalds and restaurant groups like Darden Restaurants have implemented JIT techniques to ensure that the right ingredients are available at the right time. Another example is Kelloggs, which has implemented JIT in production, inventory, distribution, and operations. They obtain raw food materials from suppliers all over the globe and use JIT to optimize production, inventory costs, and budgets. Aerospace Industry The aerospace industry requires precise coordination and synchronization of various components to meet stringent production schedules. Companies like Boeing and Airbus have implemented JIT inventory management to ensure the timely delivery of aircraft parts and streamline their complex supply chains. Boeing took the initiative in the 1990s to apply JIT across their supply chain. The decision was made to work more closely with suppliers and remove redundancies, improve quality, and reduce costs. They rely heavily on their supply base to meet customer demand. They implement lean manufacturing and work as integrators of large parts and systems. Apparel",

Apparel and Fashion Industry In the fast-changing world of fashion, staying ahead of trends and minimizing inventory risk is crucial. Companies like Nike, Adidas, and HM have adopted JIT inventory management to optimize their production and distribution processes by keeping inventory levels low and leveraging real-time data. Zara, for example, is a company that operates on the principle that inventory equals death. Stocking apparel is costly and risky since the variety of styles, sizes, and colors require more inventory. Therefore, these fast fashion leaders are incredibly quick in bringing goods to market, and they own their entire supply chain. Fifty to sixty percent of their product line is locked in at the start of a season, i.e., manufacturing and design of up to fifty percent of their clothes happen in the middle of the season. If a particular design suddenly starts trending, Zara reacts by creating new products and designs and getting them into the market before the trend reaches its peak. Nike has utilized JIT to improve their disconnected production facilities all over Southeast Asia. It resulted in cutting lead times, increasing productivity, and faster introduction of new models. Medical Equipment Industry Manufacturers of medical equipment and devices face the challenge of managing a diverse range of products with varying demand patterns. JIT inventory management enables companies like Siemens Healthineers, GE Healthcare, and Medtronic to maintain optimal inventory levels, minimize carrying costs, and ensure the availability of critical medical equipment when needed. Should my business implement JIT Inventory Management? Before implementing the JIT Inventory Management system, there are several factors a business must consider. We have boiled these down to six basic questions that can help make your decision How quickly can the products be manufactured or supplied? Turnaround time is a crucial consideration before converting to JIT. How accurate is the demand forecasting? There needs to be enough confidence in the sales forecasts, that they can depict demand fluctuations and seasonality. Is the supply chain flexible enough? In the event of unforeseen circumstances like natural disasters or supplier disruptions, the system should be able to adapt. How efficient is the order fulfillment system?

JIT Inventory Management Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) It can be difficult to understand all the terminology and implementation procedures for JIT all at once. Here we have a summary and FAQs section. What is JIT inventory management? JIT (Just-in-Time) inventory management is a strategy where businesses aim to minimize inventory levels by receiving goods and materials exactly when they are needed in the production process. What are the potential benefits of implementing JIT inventory management? Implementing JIT inventory management can lead to reduced inventory carrying costs, improved cash flow, minimized storage space requirements, decreased waste, and increased overall efficiency. Is JIT inventory management suitable for all businesses? JIT inventory management is not suitable for all businesses. It works best for companies that have stable demand, reliable suppliers, and efficient production processes. Businesses with highly variable demand or unreliable suppliers may face challenges in implementing JIT effectively. What are the potential risks of implementing JIT inventory management? Some potential risks or drawbacks of implementing JIT inventory management include the risk of supply chain disruptions, reliance on a limited number of suppliers, increased vulnerability to demand fluctuations, and potential production delays if the supply chain is not reliable. What factors should a business consider before implementing JIT inventory management? Businesses should consider factors such as demand predictability, supplier reliability, production process efficiency, the cost of implementing JIT, potential risks, and the overall compatibility of their operations with JIT principles before deciding to implement JIT inventory management. Are there any alternative inventory management strategies to JIT? Yes, there are alternative inventory management strategies to JIT, such as the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model, Material Requirements Planning (MRP), and Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI). These strategies may be more suitable for businesses with specific needs or characteristics that are not well-aligned with JIT principles. Whats the difference between JIT inventory and JIT manufacturing? The major difference between JIT inventory and manufacturing is their point of contact in the supply chain. JIT manufacturing works on the principle of producing a product only when needed, and JIT inventory applies the same principle to receiving products in the warehouse. They can work together or independently. What is the difference between just-in-time inventory vs. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)? Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a formula for identifying stock replenishment levels. Favorable inventory items are regulated to reduce storage and order costs. It is typically useful when order, holding and demand costs remain consistent over time.

    "text": "31052023 Warehouse automation is a crucial aspect of supply chain management that has been undergoing significant changes in recent years due to the evolution of technology. The use of automated systems in warehouses has improved efficiency, reduced errors, and increased productivity while lowering labor costs. In this article, we will look at the trends in warehousing automation solutions. What is Warehouse Automation? Warehouse automation involves the use of technology to substitute manual labor performing repetitive tasks with automated systems, so that skilled labor can shift their focus elsewhere, to more productive operations. But what is the scope of this technology? It encompasses a range of different systems, from simple conveyors to sophisticated robots that can perform complex tasks. They can be implemented in every phase of operations, including receiving, put away, picking, sorting, data analytics and so on. Automation can be implemented in a warehouse with differing levels of complexity depending on requirements and budgets. There is no single solution that fits all warehouses. For some businesses, partially automated warehouses , where only particular steps in the workflow are automated, may be a better fit. These can include technologies like automated conveyor systems, robotic picking and sorting systems, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), or even advanced warehouse management software . The other aspects of warehouse operations, for example, complex decision-making or tasks that require fine motor skills, still rely on the involvement of the human workforce. Past Methods of Warehouse Management vs New Automation Trends Old methods of warehouse management have been phased out over the past decade to make way for the implementation of AI and WMS software. The WMS software allows warehouse managers to gain real-time visibility on all receiving, inventory control, and order management activities for several warehouses on the same platform. It also delivers the ability to receive detailed analytical inputs on the various areas of improvement in warehouse operations . For example, the WMS can apply ABC analysis to improve the storage allocation in the warehouse. It can also help improve the number of backorders . The latest iteration of WMS software has improved enormously on the way things used to be done in warehouses Past Warehouse Management Methods New Automation Trends Manual inventory tracking and management Automated inventory tracking and management using RFID and barcodes Use of paper-based documentation Paperless documentation with the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) Manual order picking and packing Automated order picking and packing using robots and automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) Limited use of technology Use of technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT) High reliance on manual labor Reduced reliance on manual labor The Benefits of Warehouse Automation It is evident that automated systems reduce reliance on manual labor, which translates to reduced errors, and improved efficiency and productivity. Besides these, there are manifold benefits of adopting new warehouse automation technology, as listed below Maximized space utilization Making narrow aisles with higher shelves and greater storage per unit area, system suggested location, consolidation of inventory based on system suggestion, machine learning to plan for future orders are some strategies that can be deployed to maximize space with the help of automation. Reduced turnaround time Warehouse automation may have high initial setup costs, but the benefit far outweighs the risk. Remember, an inefficiently run warehouse is going to be far more expensive in the long run. Quick Upscaling Demand is a volatile thing.

A key benefit of warehouse automation solutions is that they can scale up as required. Sustainability Warehouse automation can provide many long-term solutions including better service, efficient energy use, lower costs and improved data accuracy. Warehouse Automation Trends Warehouse automation companies have been ramping up research and development efforts in order to develop better technology. Some futuristic technologies you may encounter in warehouses in recent years are Robotics Robotics is the most significant trend in warehouse automation. With advancements in robotics technology, collaborative robots (or cobots) are being used for more complex tasks such as order picking, packing, and even unloading trucks. A recent study found that cobots can increase efficiency by almost 30! Cobots have also become more affordable, making them accessible to small and medium-sized businesses. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) AI and machine learning for the purposes of inventory control and warehouse automation are becoming more prevalent in recent years. They have multiple applications in areas like data analytics , picking and packing processes, logistics, IoT sensors, RFID and so on. For example, they have the ability to predict demand and optimize inventory levels, reducing the need for excess inventory. According to the BCIs Supply Chain Resilience Report, 69 of companies still dont have complete visibility of their supply chain. This is one of the primary issues AI has been trying to address in supply chain management. AI and ML implementation can improve on a number of key areas Resource planning Supplier relationship management Technical downtimes Transportation costs Quality and safety Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of connected devices that allows for interaction and sharing of information in ways that will improve efficiency and coordination. In the context of warehouses, this may refer to warehouse management systems, fleet management systems, predictive maintenance software and so on. IoT devices such as sensors, RFID tags, and beacons are used to track inventory and monitor warehouse conditions such as temperature and humidity. This data is then analyzed using AI and ML algorithms to optimize warehouse operations. An industrial IoT in your warehouse ultimately leads to Filling gaps that cause inefficiencies spotted by the software Reduce unexpected downtime or equipment being used inefficiently Informed decision making with all the data on hand Cloud-Based Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) Cloud-based WMS has become an indispensable part of many warehouses due to its scalability, affordability, and accessibility. It allows businesses to manage their warehouse operations from anywhere in the world, reducing the need for on-premise hardware and software and cutting maintenance costs.

Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) move across the warehouse floor to transport goods from one location to another. They can function without an onboard operator. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) work in a similar manner, but require an onboard operator. They are used for order picking, reducing frequency of repetitive actions and the time and labor required for these tasks. Wearables Wearable technology has started to become more commonplace due to its portability and convenience. Devices like augmented reality smart glasses, GPS tracking bracelets and finger trigger gloves are equipped with smart sensors that can help with stocking, receiving, navigating, shipping and even instructions on lifting objects. This means lesser paperwork and workers freed up to focus on picking tasks. Voice Picking Voice picking systems are typically integrated with the WMS or ERP system. They are a method to manage order fulfillment through verbal commands, conveying information to workers through headsets. They typically make use of automatic identification technology . The system can determine the requirements of the order and inform the worker of the location and quantity, and can also answer simple questions about the orders. Pick-to-Light and Put-to-Light Systems Pick-to-light is a system that uses light indicators for order fulfillment. Scanning the barcode assigned to the order triggers the light mounted on each rack to indicate which items to choose for the order. The purpose is to eliminate the need for handling pick tickets. Put-to-light systems also work in a similar way, but indicate put-away rather than picking locations. On scanning a barcode, lights indicate where an item must be put-away for storage. Using lighting systems for picking and put-away processes can help warehouse operations Improve picking accuracy Reduce costs of training Increase productivity Automated Sortation Systems Automated sortation systems have the capabilities to pivot, drop, tilt or push items, some handling cases or totes, and some handling individual units onto the right conveyor belts so that they can be diverted to where they need to go. It eliminates the manual labor element from the sorting process using technology like barcode scanners and sensors. This usually leads to Lower processing times Reduced reliance on manual labor Greater accuracy in order fulfillment Predictive Maintenance Maintenance activities in a lot of warehouses are typically reactive in response to a problem or disruption of daily operations. Predictive maintenance is the process where problem areas are monitored and defects are detected before they occur and throw a wedge in operations. Software designed for predictive maintenance typically has the capabilities to take precautionary measures and schedule maintenance before a major issue occurs.

    "text": "Warehouse management systems (WMS) are a vital tool for any company that deals with inventory management. Implementing a WMS can help a business streamline operations, increase efficiency with better picking and sorting strategies, and reduce costs. The success of a WMS implementation depends on several factors, including planning, execution, and monitoring. Why does WMS implementation require a special focus? After researching and choosing a WMS vendor that is the right fit for your business, you might assume the job is done. With applications like warehouse management systems , you must remember that it isnt just another piece of software it is an indispensable operational tool that becomes a part of the business infrastructure. Therefore, smooth implementation is essential. It is important to acknowledge the changes in operations and warehouse working culture that it brings about. Employees must be trained in adapting to the new technology. If you are still on the fence about what a WMS can do for you, read about why you need warehouse management systems. To ensure maximum return on investment, you must be aware of the common mistakes made by companies when implementing a warehouse management system 1. Inadequate Planning The first and most common mistake businesses make when implementing a WMS is inadequate planning. Companies often rush the implementation process without fully understanding their requirements or the needs of the employees on the floor, which leads to poorly planned implementation. A well-planned implementation requires a thorough analysis of the companys existing processes, a clear understanding of the WMS capabilities, and a comprehensive project plan. 2. Lack of Employee Training A lack of employee training on the use of the system can be detrimental. A WMS requires employees to use new technology, follow new processes, and work in a new environment. Without proper training, employees may not understand how to use the WMS, which can lead to errors and inefficiencies. In addition, employees may resist the change, which can cause further delays and difficulties in the implementation process. It is essential to provide adequate training to employees before, during, and after the WMS implementation to ensure a smooth transition. 3. Incomplete Data Migration Data migration is a critical component of the WMS implementation process. However, some businesses make half-baked attempts at data migration that leaves a lot to be desired in terms of organization and clarity. To avoid this, it is essential to develop a data migration scheme that includes data mapping, data cleansing, and data verification. This scheme should also include a contingency plan in case of any issues during the migration process. 4. Poor Communication Poor communication can really disturb the onboarding process. Implementing a WMS requires coordination between different departments, vendors, and employees. It is essential to establish clear communication channels, assign responsibilities, and set up regular check-ins throughout the implementation process. 5. Insufficient testing Testing is critical when implementing a WMS. Organizations must conduct thorough testing in each phase to identify any issues and ensure that the application is being customized to their requirements. They should also perform testing in an environment that simulates the actual day-to-day operations to reduce the risk of errors in a live environment. Testing should be ongoing throughout the implementation process and after go-live. Skipping a few stages of testing to save costs will only cause greater harm in the long run. 6. Underestimating the complexity Implementing a WMS is a complex process that requires careful planning and execution. Many organizations underestimate the complexity of implementing a WMS and the resources required. Organizations must be prepared to allocate sufficient time and resources to the project, including project",

Many organizations underestimate the complexity of implementing a WMS and the resources required. Organizations must be prepared to allocate sufficient time and resources to the project, including project management, IT resources, and personnel. 7. Over-reliance on automation Automation may be a key benefit of a WMS, but organizations must be careful not to over-rely on it. Automation cannot replace human judgment and decision-making entirely. There must be a balance between automation and human intervention, especially with decision making. The system is only an aid. 8. Lack of integration Many organizations make the mistake of implementing a WMS as a standalone system, without integrating it with other critical business applications. A lack of integration can result in data silos, duplication of effort, and reduced efficiency. Organizations must ensure that their WMS integrates seamlessly with other systems, such as their enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, transportation management system (TMS), and customer relationship management (CRM) system. 9. Refusing to let go of legacy processes It is crucial that the employees on the warehouse floor are able to adapt and accept change. Often the implementation of a WMS creates a lot of foundational changes that may be a complete departure from the way things used to be done. Employees cannot be holding on to the way things were done. The solution to this is to ensure that employee training is done in a comprehensive manner, and the employees understand the fact that the WMS is a very effective tool in help with smoother operations. If this means change, employees must learn to adapt. 10. Too much focus on edge case scenarios When managers or supervisors spend too much time on exception workflows in the implementation phase, they begin losing focus on the key processes. One way to ensure the best results from WMS implementation is to ensure that things like receiving or dispatch flows are prioritized over anything else. How does one avoid these pitfalls? When a competent team can guide users through the onboarding process and help train employees, a lot of these issues can be avoided. A coordinated effort from the WMS service provider and an in-house team can work wonders in fulfilling the entire potential of the software. With PALMS you will be getting a top-of-the-shelf product that not only improves current operational processes and warehouse throughput, but also helps avoid common pitfalls with the rapid, yet simple and accessible onboarding process. Our team ensures that all the bases are covered in terms of implementation procedures. This article has been written by Gurudatta.

    "text": "ERP VS WMS Deploying enterprise level systems to manage and maintain inventory has become extremely crucial to run business operations and to ensure continuity of the supply chain in the modern world. Timely customer fulfilment is highest in demand and a key parameter to measure efficiency of the business process. Terms like enterprise resource planning (ERP) and warehouse management system (WMS) are often used interchangeably. However, there is a difference between ERP and WMS, although ERP may have capabilities to manage the warehouse, there are limitations in terms of capturing entire warehouse operations. In order to differentiate between ERP and WMS, it is important to acknowledge their purpose and definition. Both ERP and WMS play a crucial role in maintaining the distribution and supply chain. WMS is a system used to manage, capture and control physical operations of the warehouse. It displays inventory status on real-time basis along with various reports to measure the KPIs . The core features of WMS include Master data setup for locations (Bins, MHE, Docks etc.), SKUs, customers and suppliers Receiving and putaway operations with built in location suggestion algorithm Allocation of SKUs based on rules like FIFO, FEFO, FMFO and LIFO for customer orders Guided putaway and picking operations based on walking pattern Inventory reconciliation methodologies like Stock taking and cycle count Managing exceptions like damage, shortage, excess during operations Handing operations on hand held terminal (HHT) with embedded scanners enabling users to track live locations Modern WMS also provides advanced functionalities like 3PL billing, wave picking, replenishment forecasting, yard management, cross docking and cross stuffing, kitting and resource management (human, machines and materials). ERP system are module based centralised systems for capturing and processing information across various departments of business including finance, accounts, production, purchase, inventory management, HR, sales and marketing to maintain information integrity and facilitate flow of information across various functions. Modern ERPs accommodate basic Inventory management functions at higher levels however, functions like location management, operations management and tracking are not part of the inventory management module. ERP has all in one solution to help streamline entire business however, it may get expensive as the company grows along with the user base and implementations of additional module. A WMS is a specific purpose software used for managing operations at the warehouse and optimizing inventory. Although ERPs are designed and configured with respect to the business goals, they may take longer time for implementation depending on the modules and size of the organization. Whereas for WMS implementation, can be completed in shorter timeframe. Best of WMS systems in the market are capable of integrating with ERP system, CRM or accounting system, however, they can be implemented as a standalone system. ERP and WMS handle different functionalities. However, to realize the organizational goals it is ideal that both the systems work in conjunctions. This article has been written by Gurudatta.

    "text": "What is Inventory Forecasting? Inventory forecasting is the method to estimate or predict the stock required to be procured in the warehouse to meet the customers demands. The predictions are based on past orders by the customer based on the quantity of SKU, number of orders, and market conditions (for seasonal products) Advantages of Forecasting It helps to maintain accurate inventory levels in the warehouse. There is a reduction in excess inventory, especially slow-moving stock within the warehouse which remains lying for a long-time occupying warehouse space. Workforce requirements can be predicted based on incoming orders. It helps in saving extra labor costs within the warehouse. It gives an added advantage to 3PL operators and their customers (supplier to the warehouse) of cost-efficient solutions. Reduction in back order or cancellation of order from the customers due to availability of inventory in the warehouse. This leads to higher customer satisfaction and improved turnaround time of sales order, as multiple orders are not required due to cancellations Reduces inventory holding cost and storage utilization in the warehouse. Warehouse reduces in procurement of slow moving items and thus reduction in inventory holding cost. Methods of Inventory Forecasting Naïve Forecasting This is one of the easiest methods of forecasting where past data is considered to predict the future requirements. In this method, past data is measured over a particular time period and same estimate is made for the future needs. Example Grocery purchase in a family over the past month is considered to estimate the same for next month. The same amount grocery is estimated as requirement for next month also. It is the easiest way of working to predict the needs as this does not require heavy statistical calculations or modelling. Additionally, this method does not include the market factors or customer habits which may continually change. The time period for this method is also subjective to the party following the method which may change from period of few months to year. Demand Forecasting There are various other factors apart from past sales which may change requirement in the future. These methods can be market conditions, seasonal changes, launch of new product, changing of customer habits and many more. Demand forecasting incorporates all of these methods in order to estimate the demands of the product and thus help in the procurement accordingly. For example, the demand of mangoes during the summer season (April-June) in Indian market increase exponentially and thus this factor goes into demand forecasting in order to estimate the demand of mangoes for entire calendar year where higher demand is skewed towards summer season. There are two major techniques for demand forecasting Quantitative Forecasting These techniques are more based on statistical approaches and data models based on the previous demands and other external conditions. There can be any number of external conditions as seasonal demands, product launches, holidays, government taxes or subsidies among others which are all part of techniques to get most accurate demands. Qualitative Forecasting These techniques mainly looks at the human behavior towards the demands rather than mathematical data. These techniques tend to consider knowledge of how the market changes based on the past human sentiments towards external factors apart from previous sales. For example trend vocalforlocal is estimated of increase the sales of products which are manufactured by Indian companies, thus increase in their demands. Forecasting Techniques In this blog, we will specifically discuss five quantitative techniques of forecasting Exponential Smoothing Adaptive Smoothing Moving Average Regression Analysis Life Cycle Modelling Exponential Smoothing Exponential smoothing is quantitative forecasting technique which assumes that the data in future will be",

Forecasting Techniques In this blog, we will specifically discuss five quantitative techniques of forecasting Exponential Smoothing Adaptive Smoothing Moving Average Regression Analysis Life Cycle Modelling Exponential Smoothing Exponential smoothing is quantitative forecasting technique which assumes that the data in future will be replicated similar to past data. It uses weighted average based on this assumption and predict the future use inventory based on replication of past data. This method is usually used for short term predictions and easier to implement as compared to other methods due to lack of other variables in the assumptions. Adaptive Smoothing Adaptive smoothing method incorporates different variables based on the data available. It uses automation to collect data and define variables based on that data. This method leads to having specific variables which are recorded from the data available and necessary for making predictions Moving Average Moving average is one of the easiest method of quantitative forecasting to predict the future requirement. It takes in the subset of the entire dataset available for use and create model to predict the result based on the subset in a given time range. This method takes into account the regular past trends in the data but ignore the seasonal or other relevant trend and thus those attributes should be considered separately while using this method of forecasting. Regression Analysis Regression is one of the standard modelling techniques which creates a relationship between dependent and independent variables, both of which are predefined based on understanding of the business and data. This method can be used to predict the result more accurately as it includes all kind of variables including seasonal which are usually not incorporated in other methods. It all provides techniques to check the accuracy of the prediction based on the model created. Life Cycle Modelling Life cycle modelling as the name suggests focus on analyzing the product and its potential market growth. It takes into account the data from different types of market, consumer trends, late growth, seasonality and many other factors that determine a product life. This method of prediction is mainly based on the product specific information rather than entire set of data available for all the products. Thus, this kind method mainly used of new product for the life cycle analysis is being carried out during product development stage. Conclusion Looking at the points mentioned above, it can be concluded that inventory forecasting is a very strong warehousing techniques to have efficient and cost-effective operations. It also provides insight into the usage space and nature of the inventory at the same time. Having a forecasting technique in any warehouse and thereby warehouse management system provides an edge to any warehouse team over their competitors. This article has been written by Gurudatta.

    "text": "All of us who are into the dynamic business and digital world have heard the term Industry 4.0. Now what is Industry 4.0? The world is transforming continuously since the ancient ages. We are amid the digitization of manufacturing which is called industry 4.0. It has evolved from manual machine operations and production to mass production with electrical machines, to electronics automation and the contemporary cyber-physical systems, involved in decision-making, smart machines, and a lot more (Marr, 2018). Supply Chain 4.0 Where the Industry 4.0 revolution has impacted the whole world, the supply chain had to become resilient accordingly. Reorganizing the supply chain with advanced technologies, big data analysis, and evolving automatic storage and retrieval systems is referred to as supply chain 4.0 (World Trade Organization, 2019). Supply chain 4.0 uses the Internet of Things (IoT) transforming the model from unidirectional to omnidirectional. Where multiple stakeholders are involved, starting from multi-tier suppliers to consumers and investors, businesses need relevant information on the go. We have two major types of information-sharing models one is traditional on-premises and the second is web-based or cloud software. On-premises software helps within the organization whereas information available on the cloud is readily available to all stakeholders. If you are a logistics manager or supervisor in a firm, youll have to monitor the inventory and warehouse anywhere at all times. With a traditional WMS, you would have to download daily transaction data every evening and transfer it to your computer to analyze it accordingly. This data will be used offline only. However, having PALMS will make it all easy. For whatever requisite data you need, just connect to the internet, log on to the web-based cloud WMS and access all the information at any time. In the below parts of the article, well discuss the importance of WMS, especially during the COVID situation. Why Cloud WMS particularly during COVID-19? Global Warehouse Management System (WMS) market size is expected to reach 3.379 billion by 2027 from 1.88 billion in 2020, at a CAGR of 8.6 (Market Watch Press Release, 2021). The markets anticipate that WMS market will witness substantial growth because large scale companies are rapidly moving to cloud WMS due to the following seven major reasons 1.Scalability Limits in Traditional WMS Traditional WMS is limited in size and resources. The software has limited scalability to owners resourcefulness. It withstands heavy cost of hardware and license upgradation. The organizations need to pay separately for on-premises WMS maintenance equipment through database upgradation, license management, disaster recovery management, database backups, etc. Whereas the cloud infrastructure delivers all these WMS maintenance and license upgradation factors with 99.9 uptime and automatic backups. During the pandemic, the IT personnel at all firms had limitations to their physical movement following the COVID SOPs. The businesses were disrupted halting the movement of products and individuals. It was difficult for the firms to purchase equipment and install it at their premises. Cloud-based WMS provides high-power servers and licensed software to their customers. So, the use of web-based or cloud WMS has increased since COIVD. Hence, cloud WMS has become more convenient and popular as compared to the traditional one. 2. Accessible at all Times Anywhere On-premises WMS usually requires to buy VPN licenses, a leased line for communication and train the staff to configure and maintain those VPNs. The on-premises model also requires sufficient power backup to support the physical production servers. Whereas the service providers of SaaS and cloud computing are available round the clock. Cloud WMS offers an efficient 99.9 accessibility, powerful antivirus software and takes responsibility for resource optimization. The SaaS model",

The on-premises model also requires sufficient power backup to support the physical production servers. Whereas the service providers of SaaS and cloud computing are available round the clock. Cloud WMS offers an efficient 99.9 accessibility, powerful antivirus software and takes responsibility for resource optimization. The SaaS model guarantees about 10-15 fail-safe mechanism backups on server farms for power accessibility with no question of the production server shutting down. Efficient customer service representatives are also available to guide the customers in a friendly manner. So, being an internet-based service, it reduces complexity for software users. Furthermore, authorized stakeholders can access the information anywhere in the world, with just an internet connection in their own laptops. Being a logistics manager or supervisor, youll need a VPN license and leased connection while using a traditional WMS. But if you are using a cloud WMS e.g., PALMS , you only need an active internet connection on your own laptopsystem and can resolve any particular issue anywhere, anytime. 3. Faster Processing System Traditional WMS can utilize the sources available at the user end, whereas cloud WMS utilizes high-tech hardware already acquired by the service provider. Basic functions of a WMS are to process inventory transactions and storeretrieve the stock. Moreover, various organizations started analyzing big-data to evaluate the suppliers and product availability during COVID-19. Firms required large configured servers to store and handle big data. The firms having cloud WMS did not need to upgrade their hardware, as they just had to upgrade processing and storage capacity on servers and start using them instantly. They saved their costs and kept the focus on the core business instead. 4. Data Security System Nothing is more important than securing sensitive information, and nothing is better than doing it by moving on cloud (Aptean, 2020). Firms show concerns about their data security with the on-premises model. They need to expend separately on security systems like anti-malware, firewall, etc. along with the WMS server hardware. Furthermore, they need to keep updating the security systems regularly. However, cloud servers have already installed various types of hardware and software for data security and keep updating automatically. 5. Increase Visibility of Inventories During Pandemic More than 70 of the organizations were analyzing and mapping their suppliers during the first four months of the pandemic. The firms had no clue that how many of their suppliers would be able to dispatch consignments and how many were stuck in the lockdown or red zone areas (Eshkenazi, 2020). Only those firms were able to react immediately who responded proactively and marked their suppliers. So, firms having software access at all levels in the chain responded resiliently with agility. Cloud WMS provides visibility to all stakeholders across the chain, starting from all tier suppliers to the final consumers. For example, logging on to PALMS online, the supplier can see that how much product balance is available at the retailers end. The same information will be available for the manufacturer and distributor. The distributor will ask the manufacturer for production and the supplier will push the raw materials to the manufacturer. Hence, it reduces the chances of bullwhip effects, stock-outs and helps to manage the inventory holdings. 6. Low Upfront Costs Shipments went to a halt due to limited movements during COVID resulting in",

Hence, it reduces the chances of bullwhip effects, stock-outs and helps to manage the inventory holdings. 6. Low Upfront Costs Shipments went to a halt due to limited movements during COVID resulting in an exorbitant surge in global shipping costs. The supply chain had to be operative in food and other sectors. For better communication and ready availability of information, the supply chain needed solutions. We already discussed the importance of information visibility across the chain above, but the question is how to achieve it? The web-based solution became the most practical option for this purpose. Online service providers found it as an opportunity and offered web-based solutions at affordable prices. One of the major reasons is that cloud WMS does not need special infrastructure like installation of a dedicated server, networking, software installation on all terminals etc. It can be used on the existing computers on the existing internet connection. 7. Day to Day Collaboration with Suppliers and Buyers Working in a network connecting the customers with suppliers through multi-tier links adds value and makes the network more efficient. When all links and participants of the chain work together, they become more resourceful and agile. During the COVID situation, agile and resilient organizations performed more effectively as compared to their rivals (Steinberg, 2020). For an efficient product flow, efficient WMS based on the cloud would be a more viable option. It is integrated at all levels, horizontally and vertically. Horizontal integration means firms either acquire or merge with each other belonging to the same industry, and share information to gain higher market power. Whereas, vertical integration means integration among all tier suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and buyers. An integrated supply chain model works more resiliently (Mandal, 2016). So, the suppliers and buyers working together in collaboration makes the supply chain model more resilient instead of them working independently. Inventory Management had been carried out by maintaining manual records before the computer age. It was quite difficult to analyze, calculate and maintain the records properly. After the introduction of information technology, records were shifted to spreadsheets. But still, analytical errors on manual entries existed. Huge data analysis by humans may incur a lot of errors, but powerful cloud computing makes it more efficient and error-free. Automation in businesses changed the whole world. Automatic supply chain systems including WMS were introduced. It eliminated the errors in various calculations e.g., Re-Order Point count, inventory tracking, cycle counts, etc. Currently available on-premises WMS are adaptive and customizable. However, they have associated high costs and the implementation is time-consuming. The introduction of a cloud or web-based WMS is more beneficial because of its easy, time-saving implementation and lesser upfront costs. Besides COVID-19 like pandemic crisis brought much uncertainty in businesses. So, it is the need of the hour for firms to adopt transform to cloud technologies for much efficiency, reliability and sustenance even during uncertain times.

    "text": "Dashboard Storytelling Tell stories with Data! Introduction to Dashboard Today, we live in a world where there is a problem of data overload. Hence, we, at times, end up processing the wrong set of data which can be really frustrating leading to wrong decision-making. Presenting the whole data concisely brings a lot of clarity and efficiency in pulling the right information. Data analysis can change the way you conduct your business. Dashboard storytelling is the need of the hour. It is the visual representation of data related to business processes and strategies combined with the art of storytelling. Dashboard, very similar to a story, is designed keeping its audience in mind. It conveys information and inspire audience to take informed decisions. The purpose of dashboard is to represent the performance of the business in a holistic manner to promote better understanding of performance parameters. Purpose of a Dashboard Improves Efficiency Dashboard summarizes the overall performance of the business which is easy to understand and comprehend, and enables a user to take the right decisions. Hence, it is a time-saving and efficient way of visualizing data. E.g., a logistics manager can gauge the demand and supply of goods in a warehouse with the help of dashboard thereby estimating the demand of vehicles per day efficiently. Better Visibility A dashboard provides snapshot of current condition of a business thereby improving visibility and early signs of any issues in the business. E.g., a Production Manager can use a Sales Dashboard to estimate the monthly demand of a particular SKU and hence, estimate requirement for procurement of an SKU thereby reducing production cost. Better decision-making A dashboard enables user to understand the business performance thereby enabling them to take more informed decision. E.g., a Warehouse Supervisor can track Order Lead Time to take a decision how the Picking should be done in the Warehouse. Different Dashboard Stories for different Stakeholders Dashboard Storytelling is not just about presenting everything we have at hand in the form of graphs, charts, etc. A thorough study needs to be done to know what to present and what will be the desired output. An important consideration here should be who will be consuming the data i.e., audience who will be using the dashboard. Different dashboards should be designed for different audience. Top management in a company would like to see overall performance of the company while Office manager is concerned about daily operations. A perfect example of this would be a Warehouse Dashboard. Dashboard designed for multiple warehouses of a company and analyzed by Country Supply Chain Manager will have following KPIs Customer TAT Customer Confidence Overall Profitability On the other hand, dashboard designed for a single warehouse and analyzed by Operations Manager will have following KPIs Receiving Efficiency Inventory Turnover Rate of Sales Return Backorder Rate Order Lead Time Hence, different Stakeholders in a company need different dashboards. Consistency in data is the need of the hour! Now the next big question is even if we have identified the stakeholder for whom the dashboard is to be built, how can we build such a system to ensure consistency in the data. One of the ways to ensure consistency in the data is to minimize the manual intervention at the generation side of data as well as at the consumption side of data. For minimizing manual intervention, process should be made more System-Oriented rather than People-Oriented. In a warehouse, this can be achieved by using a Warehouse Management System which will guide users at each step of the operation instead of users taking their own decisions. This will ensure",

Dashboard Storytelling not only presents performance of the business to the stakeholders but also encourages them to take relevant actions by tracking performance. It also enhances visibility and thus, right decisions can be taken at the right time. For designing an efficient dashboard for a stakeholder, first we need to identify right KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and track those identified KPIs in a dashboard for different stakeholders. We also need to be sure of integrity of the data presented and this can be done using automated systems reducing human intervention. This article has been written by Gurudatta.

    "text": "Why is optimisation required? Optimizing warehouse operations is essential to maximize the overall efficiency of a warehouse. Non-optimized operations often lead to increased lead times for operations such as Put-away, Picking, Loading, and Dispatch operations, which in turn can affect the timely as well as the quality of the delivery. How to optimize warehouse operationsHow to increase warehouse throughput The objective of warehouse optimization is to ensure that we increase the warehouse throughput in terms of the number of times items have moved per operator hour or the number of items that can be processed in a given time To achieve this objective, the following steps need to be carried out Decrease the stepstime required for operators to move the items Accurate movement of items within and out of the warehouse to avoid inaccurate movements and hence adding on extra time to correct the movements To meet the objectives mentioned above, we need to identify the major functions that affect the overall efficiency of the warehouse and correct it. For example, to increase picking efficiency our put-away process needs to be corrected. In case, during put-away, SKUs are not placed in correct areas or bins, we will never be able to achieve picking efficiency. The following three methods can be implemented to increase the warehouse throughput ABC Analysis based put-away The first step to maximize the throughput of the warehouse is to optimize the put-away. Slotting fast movers at the right location during put-away has a direct impact on picking performance. This can be achieved by For example, A and B classified products can be stored in high throughput bins, which are basically easily accessible locations at a convenient height. High throughput locations are also generally designated as pick face locations.This will lead to improved picking performance as picking effort and time for fast movers are significantly reduced. Replenishment The second step to maximize the throughput of the warehouse is to identify the correct replenishment strategy. Accommodating the total inventory of fast movers in high throughput locations may not be possible, hence pick face locations and bulk locations can be designated, with replenishment from bulk locations to pick face locations at regular intervals. This involves Implementation of the points mentioned above results in the ability to handle a higher number of fast movers from pick face locations, which again leads to improvement in the warehouse picking performance and throughput. In addition, full Pallet replenishment minimizes inventory fragmentation at the bulk storage area. Outbound Operation Optimization The third step to maximize the throughput of the warehouse is to optimize the outbound operations starting from customer order allocation. Right break-up of customer order allocations across bulk locations and pick face locations minimizes picking trips and replenishment jobs. This can be handled by Pallets to be allocatedpicked from bulk locations Full boxes and Pieces to be allocatedpicked from pick face locations The above steps results in avoiding unnecessary breaking of pallets and fragmentation of inventory, minimizes picking trips, and Improves picking performance and warehouse throughput For Example Consider the following storage pattern for an SKU The conversion factor for SKU1 is as follows In this case, if the ordered quantity is 555 pcs, the correct allocation would be This ensures that there is no fragmentation in the bulk (pallets and cartons storage area) storage areas, and the pick face locations remain adequately stocked. This also improves the overall picking efficiency as minimum handling units need to be moved out of the warehouse. You can also watch the attached video to look at how to optimise warehouse operations. Conclusion Warehouse optimization to increase the",

Conclusion Warehouse optimization to increase the throughput of the warehouse is a multi-step process that involves Managing all these steps without a WMS system is highly complicated and involves a high level of dependence on operators to carry out operations as defined. In summary, a good Warehouse Management System should not only manage the operations within a warehouse but also provide the right tools to improve the efficiency and productivity of the warehouse.

    "text": "An RFP (Request for Proposal) is a document that lists the requirements of a company to address a specific area of concern. The RFP document is then released to potential vendorspartners so that they can respond based on the specific set of requirements listed in the document. Why is a Request for Proposal required? A Request for Proposal document allows a company to list down all the functionalities that are essentialdesired in a solution. The RFP also helps potential vendorspartners to understand the requirements in detail and share the best fit that their productsolution achieves. The RFP process helps a company to evaluate the received responses, and to shortlist the productsolution that meets the majority of the listed parametersfunctionalities. This process allows a company to get responses from a large number of vendorspartners about specific requirements without the cost and effort involved in a traditional process. The Process to issue a Request for Proposal Before issuing an RFP, the company should conduct internal brainstorming sessions across cross-functional teams and draw up a requirementfunction list. The requirementsfunctions identified, should be classified according to Essential Functions without which the productsolution does not meet the stated objectives Important Functions that are necessary but can be managed with workarounds Desirable Functions that are good to have which neither affects the operations nor the efficiency of the operations After listing down all the essential functionsrequirements, the evaluation criteria for the RFP needs to be finalized. The evaluation criteria should consider the responses for each of the functions listed in the RFP and assign points. This process helps in narrowing the list of potential productssolutions that need to be evaluated. RFP for selecting a Warehouse Management System The process of creating and sharing an RFP for a WMS application will follow the same steps listed above. When creating an RFP, the major pain points identified by cross-functional brainstorming will become essential functions. In the same way, important, and desirable functions need to be identified and documented. A similar study can also be conducted in your warehouse to identify Essential, Important, and Desirable requirements. This article has been written by Gurudatta.

    "text": "What is a Warehouse? A warehouse is a large physical structure used to store raw materials and finished goods. Warehouses are used by various entities like Manufacturers, Importers, Exporters, Distributors, Wholesalers, etc.., to maintain inventory of the goods they transact in. What is Warehouse Management? Warehouse management is the process of organizing and running a warehouse in the most optimal way possible. This involves, having complete control over the operations carried out in the warehouse along with optimal management of inventory, following all safety standards and protocols to ensure protection of the goods stored in the warehouse, along with the warehouse personnel and equipment. Warehouse management also involves, providing and maintaining the facilities and equipment that are critical for operations. Facilities can include Dock Levelers Material Handling Equipment like Fork Lifts, Order Pickers, VNAs, etc. Cranes or other special equipment for offloadingloading based on requirement Cold StorageTemperature Controlled Zones Typical operations carried out in a warehouse includes Inbound Operations Outbound Operations Inventory Management VehicleYard Management Location Management etc. The operations, listed above can be handled either manually or by using a Warehouse Management System. Controlling and managing a large warehouse with complex operations manually is extremely resource intensive and often leads to errors in operations. To minimize the operational overhead and dependence on warehouse personnel to manage the operations and inventory in an optimal way, a warehouse management system can be implemented. What is a Warehouse Management System? A Warehouse Management System is a software solution that controls all the activities of a warehouse A WMS provides visibility and controls critical operations like Inventory Management Location Management Receiving and Put-away Picking Sorting Packing Loading Invoicing and Dispatch Movement and Storage of Material in the Warehouse Inventory Reconciliation One of the major advantage of a WMS is that it eliminates dependency on warehouse personnel in terms of inventory status and operational decisions The system takes care of important functions like Location Suggestion Allocation Policies Guided Operations A birds eye view of a typical warehouse Let us look at how a warehouse typically works with a good WMS Inbound Operations The inbound operations typically starts with creation of a ASN (Advance Shipping Note) The ASN will contain details like Who is the supplier The Supplier Invoice Number The PO Number against which the delivery is being made SKU details Quantity and The UOM The ASN can also contain additional details like Vehicle No Trailer No Container No Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) Planning Based on the details enters in the ASN, the system generates a activity plan covering the following points A schedule for unloading based on the type of vehicle and details available in ASN Resources required for unloading in terms of Manpower Supervisors Laborers Specialist Operators for MHEs Material MHE (Material Handling Equipment) Vehicle In The next step is when the vehicle reaches the warehouse Visualization screens displayed on the TV displays information like Expected Vehicles Delayed Vehicles In-Premise Vehicles Parking Lot Status and Dock Status When the vehicle arrives at the warehouse In case the vehicle details exist in the system A license plate reader reads the license plate of the vehicle automatically and pulls up the details of the vehicle in the system The security person verifies the details in the system against the physical documents, records important checklist parameters and registers the vehicle in process and generates a Gate-Pass The system then redirects the vehicle automatically to an empty dock based on the dimensions, weight of the vehicle and the goods it is carrying In case no docks are available then the vehicle is redirected to the",

    "text": "Supply Chain Analytics and Their Importance Supply chain analytics or metrics are simple toolscalculations used in the business to measure, predict, determine and improve key areas of the business to maximize profits and reduce the time involved. Lets take a short look on the basis. What is a Supply Chain? A Supply Chain is nothing but the entire process of procurement of raw material to manufacturing to storage of the processed material- to distribution of the finished product to the vendors (Sometimes the end customers) In these rapidly evolving times with the explosive impact of e-commerce (Online Shopping) on traditional (Instore Shopping) whereabout 40 percent of shopping happens online as compared to 100 percent instore shopping as it used to a decade ago, Supply Chains have modernized themselves with the state-of-the-art technologies to ensure accurate production to delivery times, forecasting for future procurement and finally seamless and flawless integration with multiple payment channels. Like any other business, Supply Chains too face multiple challenges which vary on countless factors. Likewise, Successful Supply Chains overcome these challenges by analyzing their pain points and identifying shortcomings in their processes which is exactly where Supply Chain Analytics come in. Supply Chain Analytics or Metrics are nothing but data-driven techniques that could Vastly transform the way Supply Chains define, manage and most importantly improve their Business. Supply Chain analytics are based on multiple factors also known as KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) or KPAs (Key Performance Areas) Lets take a quick look on Major KPIs that Supply Chains consider most important 1) Productivity Capacity utilization. Production A simple measure of the total amount of goods produced in a given unit time ( days, weeks, , months etc. ) vs the maximum possible output of the goods that can be produced in the same given unit of time. Manpower utilization Happy employees make happy customers ! If your turnover is less than optimal, it is time to do some analysis on why it is so and what can be done to achieve maximum efficiency Equipment utilization This KPI simply measures the overall effectiveness of a part of or the whole production line. Availability x Performance x Quality Cycle time A combined measure of Manpower and Equipment utilization. Or simply put, the TIME TAKEN TO COMPLETE ONE CYCLE OF THE ENTIRE PRODUCTION PROCESS. 2) Storage Storage Efficiency Haphazard manners of unplanned and or unclassified ways and methods to store goods does become a highly toxic element to a supply chain. It completely disrupts the optimal ratio of TOTAL SPACE AVAILABLE FOR STORAGE VS TOTAL SPACE UTILISED. This is another key metric or KPI that Warehouse Managers must focus on. A good Warehouse Management System helps tackle this hurdle with utmost ease. Cost Total cost incurred in WH operations vs value of goods stored in that warehouse Inventory accuracy Physical inventory vs electronically recorded inventory Damages Ratio of damaged products vs total products handled Throughput Warehouse dispatching The accuracy or the ability of the warehouse management system and or the team will determine the speed and accuracy which with the stored goods are A. Located within the warehouse for picking and B. brought to the right dispatch area well before they are to be shipped. 3) Fleet utilization The delivery trucks vans just like the equipment in the warehouse can operate at an optimum efficiency if the delivery planning is flawless. This KPI is a simple measure of trucks that have delivered goods with Full load vs the total amount of trucks that have been used for deliveries. A few sub-sections of transportation may include minor but equally important",

This KPI is a simple measure of trucks that have delivered goods with Full load vs the total amount of trucks that have been used for deliveries. A few sub-sections of transportation may include minor but equally important KPIs such as On-time delivery Percentage of the deliveries made on time. In-full delivery Percentage of the deliveries made to the right address Damages Percentage of the deliveries made with incurring any damages (Both to the goods trucks equipment used) 4) Cash to Cash Cycle Although this particular KPI sounds like a factor that is completely financial it simply is the very core that will determine why and how an organization or a supply chain exists and will evolve. To further simplify ITS THE SIMPLEST MEASURE OF THE HEALTH OF THE ORGANISATION . While there quite a few formulae to calculate the ratio of this particular KPI, the simplest is the one which reveals the time consumed between the payment to the supplier (Raw Material Procurement) to Payment received from the end customers for the finished goods. THE SHORTER, THE BETTER! For a Supply Chain this would simply mean Time involved in procuring the material from the origin source (handling transport) to the time involved in storing of the material (handling storage) to the time involved in dispatch and delivery of the goods (handling transport) to the end customer. Once again THE SHORTER THE BETTER! A large number of sub-sections can be involved in the Cash-to-Cash Cycle KPI. To name a few Cost vs Sales Ratio of the Total Cost involved in Logistics vs the total value of the goods. Reverse Flow Ratio of the Total Cost involved in Logistics vs the total value of goods returned. Demurrages Ratio of the optimum billing cycle time of a unit volume of goods vs the billing cycle involving extended (unexpected) storage of goods. Damages Ratio of the cost incurred during the supply chain due to damages pertaining to the handling storage equipment, the transport trucks vans or the goods itself to the actual profit margins on the goods.

    "text": "Industry 4.0 for Supply Chain The role of AI (Part 2) This is part 2 of a 3-part blog, addressing the 3 questions below. Part 1 Industry 4.0 for supply chain The role of AI Part 2 Where does Supply Chain figure in Industry 4.0? You can find Part 1 here. How does Industry 4.0 influence Supply Chains? Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Everything (another name for IoT), bring a connected world into play. The benefits to be reaped are possible precisely because they are all connected. To elaborate this let us look at an example. The car manufacturer Toyota has established just-in-time manufacturing practices. The inventory levels of car parts that they hold have shrunk to accommodate these practices. The assembly line gets parts from Toyota plants and from their ecosystem of suppliers. Toyota conveys their need for inventory at a detailed level to their suppliers who deliver just in time. This brings down costs dramatically for Toyota. In a connected world any change in the production plan at Toyota will be automatically notified to the supplier, who in turn can ramp up or ramp down their production. Such plan changes can be in turn notified to their suppliers who can act on this information. The flow of information can traverse the entire supply chain and can result in business decisions being made in the best interest of each of the parties involved. Digital Supply Networks Digital Supply Networks are the supply chain networks of the future. They are characterized by being connected digital. They are real time networks that offer online access to services, as well as visibility in the execution. They can offer scheduled as well as on demand services and can respond to demand stimuli to fine tune the supply. Let us see what all that jargon translates to with an example. An interior designer is furnishing an office space and places an order on an ecommerce portal for specialized lighting equipment. The order includes customization such as color and style of casing and printing of the company logo on the casing. The customer has chosen to pay a premium for quick delivery. The placement of the order triggers a chain of events that flow through the digital supply chain. The factory gets a priority order that is scheduled for production. The required quantity of casing for that order is not available in stock, automatically creating a shortage alert. The system places an expedited delivery order to cover the shortage and also ensure recommended minimum inventory level for that type of casing. A forecasting model ingests data for this order, as well as the stock shortage to fine tune the minimum inventory level for the casing. The casing supplier places an on demand order on his transportation partner to deliver the casings from ready inventory to their customer. The transportation partner is an aggregator who allocates a truck based on proximity, vehicle type and other business factors. The casing supplier also starts a production run to replenish his ready inventory. His production system places an order for raw material on their supplier. A smart contract raises an invoice on the factory as per payment terms for expedited delivery. The contract settlement triggers are sent to finance departments. The factory which is now producing the lighting equipment also schedules a delivery of the finished product to the e-commerce portals designated cross dock. Their fleet provider who has a set of trucks works out an optimal fleet plan for the day based on orders on hand. The factory is informed of an ETA for the truck to",

Alternately the factory can specify an expected time that the fleet provider can factor. When the products are ready, the orders are delivered by the ecommerce company to the customer within the guaranteed time. The number of business that come into play to make this happen are numerous and they constitute the digital supply network. These businesses are connected and can send each other real time updates as well as service requests or orders. The businesses themselves are dynamic and alignrealign the execution to incoming orders. Digital Supply Networks are built using ecosystems and providers who can be tapped on need basis. These businesses are able to talk to each other digitally, thanks to APIs that allow integration. Services can be ordered, status can be tracked, alerts are pushed and the provider is truly online and real time. Some exciting technology such as smart contracts and blockchain are ushering in the potential to work with even new providers in a trusted manner. Each link the supply chain has to learn how to be real-time and dynamic in their business to leverage an ecosystem that can save costs as well as increase service levels dramatically. Retail shops, distribution warehouses, ecommerce cross docks, manufacturing units, fleet providers, aggregators, truck owners, finance departments, ports, banks and financial institutions, trusted platforms will all be part of this digital supply chain that is a living breathing organism which will respond to customer demand.

    "text": "Traditionally, warehousing in India has been made up of small unit sizes. Most warehouses were looked upon as mere godowns. The lack of world-class infrastructure has always hindered the growth of other industries that rely on warehousing and logistics. India is now witnessing a paradigm shift in warehousing due to the growth of organized warehousing and simplification of tax structure as well as other government aids. India covers a vast area of 3.3 million sq. km and has a coastline of 7,517 km. However, the entire land mass is not conducive for locating a warehouse due to different geographic, demographic, and economic disparities. Proximity of the warehouse always carries the utmost importance. According to the Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj CII Warehousing Survey (Nov 2010), proximity to the supply-demand hubs and quality infrastructure were ranked the most important factors for choosing a location than the availability of manpower, skilled labor, proximity to ports and warehousing space costs. With rapid industrialization and globalization, warehousing is receiving much-needed attention. With the Central Sales Tax (CST) going away, warehouses would get consolidated at a few places in India rather than being distributed in each individual state. This means that the warehouses grow larger in size and it becomes imperative that they become more sophisticated with sophisticated infrastructure, technology and processes. Industry players are now looking at developing centrally automated warehouses. They have realized that it is better to have few centralized inventories than small distribution centers spread across everywhere, for improved efficiency and ease of tracking. Another area in warehousing that can look at gaining momentum is order picking. Automated picking system is more efficient as it employs minimal human labor. It is flexible as well as sensitive and modular. The Positives Growth potential The demand for warehousing space is expected to grow from 391 million sq. ft. in the year 2010 to about 476 million sq. ft. in the year 2013 i.e. at a rate of 6.8 compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during this time frame. According to the Planning Commission, the 11th Plan provides for expansion of warehousing to 110m MT by 2012 from 60-70m MT. There are quite a few major logistics parks coming up around major hubs of Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and NCR. Specialty logistics parks are under construction catering to various industries such as agriculture, electronic hardware, automotive and aero-industry. There are also several rail-linked and multi-modal logistics parks. The central government has identified about 861 acres of land as Free Trade Warehousing Zones (FTWZs). These FTWZs are governed by the SEZ (Special Economic Zone) Act 2005 and SEZ Rules 2006 and 100 FDI has been allowed in these FTWZs. Infrastructure Till recently, little importance was given to the efficiency aspect of the warehouse. However, more businesses are now realizing various purposes such as storing, retrieving and cross-docking for which warehouses can be used. They have also realized that India lacks world class infrastructure when it comes to the global stage. This has exerted high pressure on the Indian government to take suitable measures to help the infrastructure grow. Industrialists and the government are increasingly looking at incorporating the best practices in the warehouse industry. Companies are focusing on warehouse layout and locations for improving efficiency of the warehouse, while reducing the cost. More companies, whether MNCs or SMEs are getting into automating their warehouses, which can help in reducing human inefficiencies. Companies are using not only devices such as RF readers but also devices such as pick-to-light and voice recognition technology.

Companies are using not only devices such as RF readers but also devices such as pick-to-light and voice recognition technology. Automation for warehouses Automating a warehouse plays a critical role in improving its efficiency. More automation modules and systems have been developed over the years. Some of them are the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), Real-time Warehouse Control Systems (RTWCS), Automated Guide Vehicles (AGVs), hand-held devices such as RF readers and pick-to-light technology, and 3PL Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). ASRS These constitute various computer-controlled methods for automatically storing and retrieving loads from certain storage locations. They have several advantages over the traditional forklift trucks. AGV An automated guided vehicle not only helps in transporting loads between shipping docks or manufacturing and storage, but also helps in storing and retrieving goods from storage locations. Automated Handheld devices These play a major role when it comes to order picking, cycle counting, transfers and other data collecting activities. Most of the handheld devices perform these actions as well as record the data. This helps in reducing human errors and paperwork while increasing efficiencies. More and more Indian companies are realizing the power and need of third party logistics (3PL). Companies are focusing on managing their supply chain mechanisms in better ways for more market penetration. With the growth in infrastructure and rising focus on core business operations, a growth in the Indian 3PL market can be visualized. The 3PL market is expected to grow at 27 CAGR within the period 2012-2014, with total revenue of nearly 5.8 billion USD by 2014. The Challenges Everything is however not so great when it comes to the warehousing scene in India. Although the Indian Supply Chain industry is seeing winds of change, warehousing is still the weak link. The growth potential is still limited due to several key challenges. Slow rate of automation adoption Till late 90s and early 2000, automation was a term virtually unheard of, except in some multi-national companies. Most of the material handling was done using manual labor. It is only with the entry of new MNCs in the late 90s and early 2000, this scenario changed. Storage and material handling equipment are receiving attention only of late. Hence, even though automation has been introduced in warehousing, the concept is still at an infant stage. There is another problem with automation adoption. Most of the storage and material handling equipment are of high cost and can be afforded by only big players. Tools and techniques such as RFID tagging, certain tracking system and certain warehousing flow simulation tools are beyond the reach of small players. Also, warehouse automation requires a considerable investment and the benefits can be seen only after a while. Most small players do not have long term plans. They are concerned more about immediate returns on their investments. Manual processes and skill gap India faces another major challenge when it comes to warehousing. Since automation is not a cheap affair, most SMEs and small players rely on manual labor in warehouses. The challenge here is to bridge the skill gap. The primary reason is that a major part of the industry is unorganized and there is scarcity of industrial skills development centers in",

    "text": "warehouse automation requires a considerable investment and the benefits can be seen only after a while. Most small players do not have long term plans. They are concerned more about immediate returns on their investments. Manual processes and skill gap India faces another major challenge when it comes to warehousing. Since automation is not a cheap affair, most SMEs and small players rely on manual labor in warehouses. The challenge here is to bridge the skill gap. The primary reason is that a major part of the industry is unorganized and there is scarcity of industrial skills development centers in India. Warehouse Management Systems Warehouses that have grown beyond traditional processes have made a leap in productivity using Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). WMS applications are now increasingly being deployed at warehouses that are looking to scale the barrier created by a combination of inefficient manual processes and increasing operating costs.

    "text": "Automatic Identification and Its Role in Warehouse Management What is Auto-ID or automatic identification? Auto-ID or automatic identification refers to the identification process of the appropriate stock keeping units (SKU) during a supply chain process, using technologies such as RFID, barcodes etc. Automatic identification technologies improve the accuracy of the SKU identification process up to 99.99. This naturally reduces errors while performing certain supply chain operations, thus reducing rework and improving time efficiency. These technologies also help businesses enforce certain rules such as FIFO, LIFO or a combination of rules that are absolutely necessary for smooth running of operations. Some of the areas where Auto-ID finds its application are receiving, binning, picking and packing. The process of automatic identification includes capturing external data via images, sounds or videos, converting it into a digital file and storing this file for later analysis. Auto-ID uses sophisticated IT infrastructure to manage the large amounts of data. Prominent Auto-ID technologies Some common Auto-ID technologies in use are BARCODE This uses encoding the information of the package in a barcode. When a barcode is attached to a package, the information of the package travels with it. A two-dimensional bar code carries more information than a regular bar code. RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) RFID has a definite advantage over bar codes as they transmit real time information of the position of the packages. With RFID, there is also a two way communication. Information of a package is encoded on an RFID tag. The RFID tag constantly emits radio frequency waves that can be captured by a receiver with a RF antenna. On the downside however, RFID has been employed only by certain companies due to the high costs of the RFID tags. BIOMETRICS Biometric identifiers use the technology of identifying human biological information associated with a particular package. These include techniques such as fingerprint identification, retina scan, and face recognition and so on. Biometric identifiers can be used for identification and authentication purposes. They find wider application in security and human movement related operations. OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR) This technology can be used to electronically translate images of handwritten, text-written or printed text into machine readable and editable form. For example, they can be used to read and interpret serial numbers which can be used for matching, tracking or sorting packages as they move through various supply chain processes. However, OCR technology is yet to improve in terms of accuracy and speed in its applications. VOICE RECOGNITION Voice recognition is another important technology used in automatic identification. It is a process where voice and speech are converted to commands to carry out certain operations. To use voice recognition, analog voice must be first converted to digital signals and compared with the data already in the database to carry out a particular command. Like any other technology, this too has a flip side. Any noise apart from the intended voice signal can alter the command sequence. Benefits of Auto-ID technology There are numerous benefits of Auto-ID technologies. A few of them are listed below. They help identify the right goods on time Accurate data capturing helps in accurate forecasting resulting in lesser stock outs. Improved count and visibility of stocks, leading to lower stock shrinkage. Accurate data collection leads to accurate binning and picking. Auto-ID also helps in reducing labor costs. Application of automatic identification processes enforces picking rules such as FIFO, LIFO or FEFO so that correct goods are delivered to the customer. Accurate information about the package can be obtained without physically opening the package. Accurate package linking to a delivery order or invoice is",

Accurate information about the package can be obtained without physically opening the package. Accurate package linking to a delivery order or invoice is possible. Role of Auto-ID technology in Warehouse Management Warehouse Management is a key area of the entire supply chain. The primary purpose of a WMS is to control various processes such as identifying the right goods from the point of reception, identification of proper storage locations, sorting, picking, and shipping of the appropriate goods. When it comes to a warehouse, there is a huge flow of products in, out and within the warehouse. WMS uses Auto-ID to effectively monitor this product flow. In modern times, warehouse management is not limited to a single warehouse anymore. The inbound, outbound and warehouse processes have implications on production management of a particular product. Close monitoring of these products can send accurate information to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or even help in accurate forecasting of that product. In its simplest form, a WMS looks at collecting data of a package or a product, interpreting it and storing it on a central database which can be either a standalone server in the warehouse or an ERP suite. Here is an example of how an automatic identification technique can help in effective warehouse management. Barcodes and barcode scanners can capture the data of an incoming part and assign it to the appropriate storagepicking location. It can also provide you accurate information about the inventory levels of a particular SKU. RFID systems can help you monitor the flow of products, collect the data and provide real-time transmission and synchronization to a central warehouse. It can also help in optimal utilization of the warehouse space and assets as well as improve the efficiency of warehouse logistics in the areas of receiving, storage, packing and shipping. Auto-ID helps WMS in achieving the objective of optimizing the cost of order fulfillment in a timely manner by managing the resources economically.",

    "text": "Lean is the flavor of the decade. With the global economic recession fairly widespread and margins under pressure, manufacturers are increasingly looking towards cost-cutting as a tool for improving profits. And where else to cut costs than that biggest of all culprits that elephantine mammoth INVENTORY ! Inventory is a necessary evil. A bundle of evils , including Space Eater The more the inventory, the more space it gobbles up Capital Blocker Sigh! All that investment in inventory lying idle for the realization Earnings Killer Not to forget those write-offs of non-moving dead stock, pilfered damaged inventory all directly deducted as stock adjustments from the companys bottom line Productivity Loser Double the inventory you hold and reduce your productivity by half. Well, not exactly, but I guess you get the idea! And so, in this season when Lean is In , exactly how LEAN is LEAN? Is your business already lean? Going lean is not an end in itself striking the right balance is the key to losing flab without your business failing to deliver. Going lean cannot be an excuse for failed deliveries. Without an effective strategy in place, you will be playing blind in this gamble of going lean. Defining a Coherent Stocking Policy Lean inventory comes with its own set of risks towards the realization of the order fulfilment ratio. A successful model balances both these concerns and helps in reducing inventory without affecting the effective service rate or order fulfilment ratio adversely. Critical to the success of any lean inventory endeavor is effective demand forecasting. So if you have not invested in necessary forecasting tools, do the same before you embark on this route. Even with effective forecasting in place, there are several outliers to the rules and these must be normalized. It must be remembered that all demand projections come with an inherent risk of being wrong. Recognizing the common factors for such a failure and fine-tuning the forecasts can mitigate the risks significantly. Some of the common types of exceptions you must be on the lookout for are Fluctuating Demand Make a judgment about what is the acceptable fluctuation in your type of industry. Fluctuating parts may be the single most potent disturbance in all your efforts to bring down inventory levels. Look at the fluctuation in conjunction with the ABC classification of your parts and define a clear Stocking Policy. Very Fast Moving A-Class Parts are stocked irrespective of their fluctuation. Not stocking such parts can hurt the business interests adversely. However in the case of B-Class Parts, very high fluctuating SKUs are not included in the stocking policy. Likewise, we gradually taper down the list of parts we will stock under each category and finally when we come to the Non-Moving E Class Parts, there is a clear direction that no such parts will be stocked in the warehouse. A back order situation is acceptable for such parts. This way we try balancing our service rates with inventory reduction. However please note there is no one single Stocking Policy that is correct for all. You will need to do the hard work to arrive at the relevant measurements and thereby a meaningful Stocking Policy for your specific business requirements. Frequency of Demand Frequency of Demand is the measure of how many different customers is the Demand sourced from. It is an indicator of the actual spread of the demand for an SKU. High demand from a few customers runs the risk of disappearing suddenly when such customers stop ordering the SKUs, leaving you with a pile of non-moving inventory. Similar to fluctuation,",

High demand from a few customers runs the risk of disappearing suddenly when such customers stop ordering the SKUs, leaving you with a pile of non-moving inventory. Similar to fluctuation, the frequency of demand is also a pointer to the risk that this demand projection carries. The lower the frequency of Demand, the higher the risk of inventory turning bad in the coming days. Like fluctuation, form an internal standard towards what is an acceptable frequency for your specific business. Define a stocking policy towards Demand Frequency and validate all Demand forecasts against this stocking policy. Campaign Seasonality related spikes Demand forecasts can go awry if there are spikes in demand due to extraneous factors like Campaigns and Seasonality. A forecasting model not tuned to the above realities, will adjust Demands on the higher side after the spike has occurred, leaving you with loads of redundant inventory. When in fact what is required is exactly the opposite. Spikes due to campaigns onset of seasons, must be recognized early and demand must be adjusted to the higher side before the spike is felt in the system. And once the event has passed, demands need to be adjusted to the lower side to prepare for the lower demand periods now coming in. An intelligent forecasting model can help take into account this and various other factors for inventory forecasts and safeguard your path to lean inventory. Measuring the Forecasting Accuracy If you are already on the forecasting bandwagon, then do not forget to take your efforts one step beyond. Make sure you are monitoring the effectiveness of forecasting, especially demand forecasting which is the Achilles heel of the entire process. Compare the actual demand with the forecast predicted and monitor for top 5 variances (both up down variances). Some of the metrics that can help you judge the efficiency of the forecasting model are indicated below Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) measurements can ensure positive variances are not offset by negative ones, thereby providing better insight into the effectiveness of the forecasting model employed. Mean Percentage Error (MPE) measurement indicates the direction of the forecast bias i.e. over-forecasting under-forecasting. In conjunction with RMSE values, MPE provides a fair assessment of the forecasting efficiency in the organization. Summary The journey towards lean inventory management is fraught with risks and wrong steps can result in a significant loss in business. Applying scientific models, using tools, etc., can help to a certain extent. However, over and above the same, it is necessary to establish internal standards for acceptable fluctuation and frequency of orders. A well-defined stocking policy is critical to the success of such initiatives. Make sure the forecast is constantly monitored and relevant metrics are regularly presented and discussed. Look out for the top 5 of wrong forecasts and carry out a root cause analysis for the same. This will give you surprising insights into what needs to be corrected in your business in this noble path of lean inventory.",

    "text": "Order picking is one of the most important processes in warehouse operations. It can contribute almost 40 to 50 of the operation cost incurred by the warehouse in comparison to receiving, storage, and shipping processes. It has a direct relation to customer satisfaction. The more efficient your order-picking process, the more orders you can process at any given time. What is Order Picking? Order picking is the process of retrieving an SKU from a storage location and transporting the SKU to the packing or dispatch area. Orders are picked up based on manual picking instructions or instructions generated by a WMS . A WMS can generate the pick list based on different methodologies. These methodologies are chosen based on the size of the warehouse, the number of different types of SKUs handled by the warehouse, and order volumes. There are multiple methodologies that can be used to pick orders. They most commonly used ones are ConsignmentOrder Based Picking Zone Picking Batch Picking Wave Picking Let us look at each of these picking methodologies in more detail 1. Consignment or Order based Picking In consignment or order based picking methodology, a picking instruction is generated in response to an order placed by a customer. The instruction will specify all the SKUs to be picked for that particular order, and the picking operator, picks the parts as per the generated instruction. The issue with this kind of picking is that, there are a very high percentage of unwanted or repeated movements across the warehouse. Also, as only one order is picked by one operator, picking lead time is very high which results in a lower picking efficiency. This methodology is suitable for Picking to be carried out for large orders (meaning with many lines) for a fewer customers. For example, picking for your distributor network. Since parts are picked for specific orders consignment, there is no sorting overhead at the dispatch bay. 2. Zone Picking In zone picking, the entire warehouse is divided into specific zones and one picking operator is assigned to each zone. Orders are consolidated, and picking instruction is generated zone wise and assigned to picking operator of that zone. As soon as the picking operation is concluded in one zone, the orders are passed on to the next zone. Automation may be achieved with effective use of conveyors between zones. 3. Batch Picking In batch picking, orders are consolidated to ensure that a picking operator does not visit the same location multiple times. Multiple orders are consolidated and picking instruction is generated. The picking operator moves from location to location while picking up SKUs from several orders. This type of methodology is suitable for high traffic movements in and out of same warehouse locations. Since parts are picked for multiple orders, this methodology will require sorting before the products are ready for dispatch. 4.Wave Picking Wave picking is a variation of zone and batch picking. In wave picking, SKUs are picked in waves, that is, multiple pick operators simultaneously pick parts from several orders. Similar to zone picking, the warehouse is physically divided into zones, but unlike zone picking, orders are not passed on to the next zone, but picked at the same time. Wave picking is one of the quickest picking methodologies and has a very short cycle time, but at the same time sorting and packing can become tricky as SKUs from multiple orders arrive at the same time. To simplify sorting operations, conveyors can be used to transfer the picked SKUs from the picking area to the packing dispatch area. Automated sortation devices may be",

To simplify sorting operations, conveyors can be used to transfer the picked SKUs from the picking area to the packing dispatch area. Automated sortation devices may be used to sort the picks by orders. The number of sorting slots available will determine the wave size, i.e. the number of orders that can be included in a particular wave. This methodology is typically where we have very large number of order with few line items such as e-Commerce orders. Conclusion The type of picking methodology to be adopted by a warehouse depends on the following criteria Size of the warehouse Number of distinct SKUs handled by the warehouse Order frequency Average order quantity lines per order and Average picks per order The above factors should be considered to identify the right picking methodology. Choosing the right picking methodology can help your business reduce errors and also ensure that targeted timelines are adhered to.

Part 2 Where does Supply Chain figure in Industry 4.0? Part 3 What is the role of AI in Supply Chain for Industry 4.0? You can find Part 2 here. So, what is Industry 4.0? Industry 4.0 is heralded as the new wave of industrial development that will usher in a new reality in manufacturing and supply chain. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is another term that captures the essence of Industry 4.0 and can be construed as the same. What does Industry 4.0 or IIoT really mean? Let us look at the evolution of industrialization and the role of technology in the same. 1.0 Simple and complex machines have been invented by humanity over the ages to make life and tasks in it easier. This has differentiated human beings from other species. The way such machines impacted life and society changed dramatically with the introduction of Steam Engines. Steam engines allowed us to power machines to do things greater than ever before and this led to the first industrialization revolution. Steam engines were used for transportation and in powering machines. 2.0 The harnessing of electricity and the ability to use it to power engines and other devices led to a quantum leap in the way industry worked. If we look at how the light bulb made the night into day, we can start fathoming the impact that electricity has had on our lives. Industry harnessed the power of electricity and advanced exponentially to even make space travel possible. 3.0 The invention of computers brought in automation. Microprocessors could be programmed with a set of instructions to carry out activities in intended sequences. We could flick a switch on and sit back and see it all in action. Robotics linked the logical microprocessor and instructions to the physical world of actions. We have entire production lines that run like clockwork. 4.0 While Industry 4.0 is being called a revolution, it is really more of an evolution. It builds on top of the automation concepts that form the core of Industry 3.0. Interconnected subsystems talking to each other, devices that are always-on generate data continuously and respond to commands or inputs in real-time form the core of an Internet of Things. This cycle will take us into a futuristic world that is not far from the science fiction that we have seen in movies. The secret ingredient in the Industry 4.0 soup If Industry 4.0 is only an evolution on top of Industry 3.0 in terms of automation, and we have always had digital relays and PLCs and SCADA systems that were connected to other computer systems over the network, the question goes begging how does Industry 4.0 usher in revolutionary change? The secret ingredient in this soup, the catalyst and enabler of this transformation is a technology that is rapidly coming of age Artificial Intelligence. Powerful computers, high speed wireless communication and vast instantly accessible data storage, have finally removed barriers that stood in the way of Artificial Intelligence systems that can work in near real time. Backed by the now mature analytics and big data systems Artificial Intelligence models help in interpretation of streams of data and decision making.

Cold storage warehouse management is a highly specialized skill that requires comprehensive knowledge of the industry, the ability to monitor processes closely occurring both inside and outside the facility, and constantly staying up to date on new and evolving state-of-the-art technological solutions available. Effective management of a cold storage warehouse is no small joke, however, it requires close attention to detail and management techniques to ensure optimum productivity is maintained, despite the harsh freezing conditions. As demand for perishable products grows across the world, efficient and effective cold chain management requires strong partnerships and quick turnaround time. Distribution centers across the regions share many of the same challenges, whether it be space optimization, picking methods or the integration of automated systems . However, managers of cold storage facilities find themselves in the peculiar situation of not only being responsible for maintaining the quality and safety of their sensitive stock , but also the safety and well-being of their workers under these typical environmental circumstances. Refrigerated and frozen foods account for the majority of products stored in cold storage warehouses. Cold storage is also vital for other industries as well such as pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals and even high-tech electronics. Challenges in Cold Storage Warehouse Management Food protection Regulating and maintaining the right temperature and humidity to maintain and extend the life of your products can be challenging as well as risky, as different products require different temperatures to be sustained. Traditional temperature monitoring systems depend solely on the experience of the operator who must be on-site to adjust and manage the whole system. Maintaining products lifecycle Correctly maintaining the temperature of perishable products is necessary to preserve its quality and safety from the start point of production through the supply chain to the consumer. Failing to maintain proper shipment leads to textual degradation, discoloring, damaging and infective growth of food products. Labelling product and racks Barcode labels create the essential link between physical products and the computer systems that monitor receiving, storage, retrieval and shipments. Appropriate freeze-grade rack labels serve as a critical factor in the entire traceability system. Freezer-grade rack labels develop a strong permanent bond on common rack surfaces, and can be applied in environments as low as -20F. Product traceability In the case of temperature excursions, finding out and determining the affected product is only possible with accurate location information. Products like fresh produce require additional control over factors such as carbon dioxide and humidity. Very Specific and accurate documentation is mandatory. Fulfillment and courier shipments The entire cold chain process should be about minimizing the time it takes to move a product through the system. Chances of vulnerabilities are higher if there are delays in handing products off from one facility to another. The average shipmentboth inbound from supplier to distribution center, and outbound to customersis made up of less-than-truckload amounts of food products. All products must be loaded correctly to prevent any cross-contamination with the raw product and damage with the heavier items placed at the bottom. Perishable foods, particularly seafood, pre-cut produce and ready-to-eat products, can become unsafe if not kept at the appropriate temperatures. Best Practices for Cold Storage Warehouse Management Conquering the alternating temperature ranges In cold storages, energy savings is a recurring concern. Its a fact that it is far more expensive to cool the air than to heat it. Moreover, different products might have varied temperature requirements. For example, vegetables need a temperature of approximately",

Best Practices for Cold Storage Warehouse Management Conquering the alternating temperature ranges In cold storages, energy savings is a recurring concern. Its a fact that it is far more expensive to cool the air than to heat it. Moreover, different products might have varied temperature requirements. For example, vegetables need a temperature of approximately 12 C , meat needs to be stored at around -2 C, dairy products at 1C and ice cream needs a temperature of 23C. So, this can be quite a challenge for third-party logistics (3 PL) who may have clients all across the year with variable storage requirements. Moreover, in a cold storage environment, re-configuring the space is not as easy as it would have been in conventional warehouses because one needs to take care of the cold temperatures. All warehouses that need multiple temperature zones or where there are a mix of products that are stored change with the season, usage of pre-fabricated wall system may look feasible and flexible. But, the refrigerated air can be expensive, so the cost savings are realized only after you make one change to the wall or a room. Opt for automation to avail savings The cost of workforce, space and energy is increasing at an exponential rate. Because of this the operators of cold storage warehouses are moving on to automation to be cost effective. The increase in the operational costs can be reduced through various automated solutions. In some cases, automation can also reduce the energy requirements by as much as 80, space requirements by as much as 50 and finally the labor requirements by about 70. Such savings can be realized in several ways. Control heat loss It will be wise to keep the area as small as possible for food since food is one of those areas where air can escape easily. High-density storage tends to create a smaller area to cool. It also develops an environment that can minimize heat loss. Storing stuffs closely creates a smaller area to cool and an environment that minimizes heat loss. Automated storage also minimizes the amount of warmer air that enters the temperature-controlled area. More the temperature of a product is upon entering, the more it impacts refrigeration cost. Automate palletizing Palletizing is a key area of operation in the cold storages with the era of robotics coming into technological usage. For many years, the manufacturers of the frozen products have been faced with a challenge of palletizing their frozen products in a manner that is efficient and cost-effective. Because of the limitation in the robotics, earlier the products had to first come off the freezer to be palletized and then put back into the freezer. This trip back and forth in the freezer led to the introduction of the ambient air when then had to be cooled. Use new robot technology, seals, cables, energy supply and lubricants specifically designed for the harsh freezer environment. This technology enables palletizing to be done inside the freezer without the use of protective heating shrouds. This eliminates conveyors and ice buildups on the products while minimizing the handling of frozen goods by workers in sub-zero temperatures. Bear in mind the impact of the cold on equipment (and people) Due to the extreme conditions and temperatures within cold storage warehouses there could be impact on",

Bear in mind the impact of the cold on equipment (and people) Due to the extreme conditions and temperatures within cold storage warehouses there could be impact on systems, including human ones, to worsen and slow down. Battery lives for equipment and forklifts can be drained by exposure to the conditions and condensation build-ups can cause technical difficulties if the equipment isnt adequately sealed waterproofed. Similarly, the continued freezing temperature can cause workers to slow down as their hands and legs become cold and uneasy for operation. This can bring down the productivity drastically and also vulnerable to behavioral issues. To avoid these disadvantages A fool proof process mechanism to be put in place Frequent audits of machineries and other capital goods Ensure any new purchases are tough equipped for the conditions Train the employees before put on to operations. Motivate them through different platforms. Spend money in good quality warm freezer wear for your employees Automate, streamline and go lean One of the key requirement in any warehouse especially in cold storage and refrigerated store rooms and warehouses is a lean process. Most cold chain companies frame their vital objective as to minimize the time it takes to move a product through the entire network system. Therefore implementing a lean processes is about reducing this turnaround time by making small changes to incrementally increase efficiency. Business houses in cold storage warehouse should keenly follow developments in the industry to ensure they are up to date and more efficient than their competitors by investing in automation, and WMS customized for cold storage wherever possible.

    "text": "ERP, Barcoding, Transport Management Systems (TMS), and Track and Trace solutions have been the growth enablers and key differentiators in the supply chain over the past decade. With these technologies now being part of the basic package for even new players, how can businesses maintain their competitive edge? How can the industry maintain the same growth rates it clocked in the past years with pressure on performance? The Current Challenge India has transitioned from a low-cost, cheap labor-sourcing location to a more mature quality-sensitive environment. However, it continues to be a price-sensitive market. Given that overall operational costs have increased manifold, businesses are under severe pressure to maintain margins. To sustain growth and profitability we must look inwards to improve the operational efficiencies, productivity and reduce wastage. Information Systems The Next Wave in Supply Chain The competitive edge Information Systems provide has changed over time. A typical view of competitive advantage in the past and now is depicted below We are witnessing the emergence of a new wave of solutions that look at finer aspects of the supply chain. This includes Extended Enterprise Solutions Warehouse Management Automated Storage Retrieval System Business Intelligence Supply Chain Design Route Planning Solutions While such solutions have been available in the past, enterprises have only now started to recognize the benefits of these systems. Broad-based adoption is on the rise. Let us look at these briefly. Extended enterprise solutions , as the name suggests, look beyond enterprises and their ERPs. Suppliers, Customers, Cross Dock Locations, 3 rd Party Providers, etc., are numerous links in a supply chain. A chain is as strong as the weakest link is an oft-heard quote and it holds all the more in the context of Supply Chains also. Extended Enterprise Solutions address this crucial gap. Strengthening the partner communication and network ensures greater predictability and a direct reduction in the cost of managing a supply chain. 3PL Warehouses, Food, and Agriculture Commodity Warehouses, and much of the Sales and Distribution warehouses continue to run on manual spread-sheet-based informal systems. This results in tremendous wastage in terms of labor, space utilization, and damaged missing SKUs. Management Controls are to that extent weakened. Warehouse Management Systems shall therefore play a key role in strengthening the overall Supply Chain. Space rentals and costs shall continue to rise steeply and this creates a direct pressure to utilize current space most effectively. Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS) help in setting up high-rise racking infrastructure and thereby ensure much greater utilization of effective space. Warehouse throughput can be increased manifold with the help of robotic stackers, conveyors, and RFIDBarcode-based interfaces. A key success factor in all ASRS projects is an effective Warehouse Management System which must optimally manage incoming inventory, location suggestions, and outgoing stock. ASRS systems are expensive to implement and the adoption of poor warehousing principles can reduce the ROI and extend payback periods unreasonably. As the size of enterprises increases, decision-making becomes all the more complex. Even seemingly common-sense decisions must be backed by adequate data. Business intelligence solutions form the bedrock of informed decision-making within an enterprise. In memory Business Intelligence solutions in particular are well placed to provide solutions to this market segment. Similarly, s upply chain design and r oute planning , much-neglected aspects of the supply chain, become important in the face of rising fuel prices.

All the above solutions leverage some form of web infrastructure. Internet and web-based solutions become very important in linking various parts of the supply chain into a meaningful whole. SaaS solutions in particular lower the cost of ownership through better risk management and improved agility in dynamic business situations. Extended enterprise and partner integration requires large-scale adoption of global standards such as Rosetta Net or ebXML. All these changing dynamics provide for an extremely exciting period ahead during which current enterprise applications will evolve into the next generation SCM systems.

    "text": "In previous blogs, we have explored various aspects of warehouse management, including order-picking methodologies , warehouse operations , and warehousing KPIs . Let us look at some of the most common terminologies you may come across while learning about warehouse management, their meaning, and usage What is TAT? TAT or Turn Around Time is an important metric in warehouse management and overall supply chain fluency. All material movement activities (loading, unloading, put-away, picking, dispatch, etc.) can be measured and benchmarked using TAT. What is Muda Hint Japanese word? Muda implies waste. In Toyota Production System (TPS), Muda represents activities that do not add any value to the production process. In the context of Inventory Management, identification, and elimination of Muda activities can help in shortening the TAT and improving productivity What is Kanban Hint Japanese word? Kanban literally means token or a Signboard. It is the underpinning concept on which the Toyota Production System, off which the concept of just-in-time inventory management was created, operates. While in itself, Kanban is not an inventory optimization strategy, it can help in bringing down the Stores inventory in case the demand for the inventory can be anticipated. What is ABC Analysis of Inventory? Inventory Analysis using ABC classification can be done based on one or multiple parameters. From operations perspective, the major dimensions measured for ABC Analysis of Inventory are Frequency of Movement, Quantity of Movement and Closing Stock (Quantity). What is Inventory Visibility? Inventory Visibility refers to the ability of the stakeholders to identify the status of inventory in real-time. In large Supply Chains, Inventory can be distributed across geographies (countries, warehouses, shelves, etc.), Cost Heads (RM, WIP, FG), stakeholders (vendors, receiving bay, store, dispatch bay, transit, 3PL service provider, etc.). Keeping accurate track of inventory reduces cost and improves productivity. What is SOBO? SOBO or Sell One Buy One is a Toyota Production System concept that leverages Kanban. In a typical SOBO scenario, the Raw Material for the next production batch is replenished only when the previous batch is consumed. Replenishment is based on a Kanban signal and the RM batch size is standardized. What is Auto-ID? Auto-Id or Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) describes various methods used to identify and capture details of items relevant in Supply Chain (like Part, Location, etc.). Barcodes, QR Codes, RFID, etc. are common forms of AIDC used in India. What is MHE? MHE or Material Handling Equipment refers to the many Inventory Movement equipment used in plants, stores and warehouses for moving inventory in a safe and efficient way. Most MHEs are designed to handle palletized load. Commonly used MHEs include Hand Pallet Truck, Fork Lift, Order Picker, etc. What is HHT? Hand-Held Terminals (HHT) are portable computers that can run specialized software. In the context of a StorePlant, HHTs can be used to read Barcodes, QR Codes and RFID tags. This helps in speeding up partlocation identification and data entry. Industrial HHTs are rugged and are resistant to accidental drops. What is Carousel? Carousel is a type of storage that is designed to optimize space in a Store. A vertical Carousel is a set of rotatable shelves that can be moved on the vertical axis. Carousels are ideal for storing small to medium size parts like fasteners, bolts and nuts. What is Pareto Analysis? Pareto Analysis is used in inventory management to the identify the top x percentage parts that contribute to the maximum number of transactions. It is a good means to identify those parts that are significant enough to be focused on for performance improvement. What is DADDAC? DADDAC also",

Pareto Analysis is used in inventory management to the identify the top x percentage parts that contribute to the maximum number of transactions. It is a good means to identify those parts that are significant enough to be focused on for performance improvement. What is DADDAC? DADDAC also known as Daily Average DemandConsumption is the average customer demand fulfilled by the FG store and the average raw material consumed by the shop floor. While the individual data points (daily data) may fluctuate based on various parameters, the average data can be used as a pointer to estimate a suitable closing stock (RM and FG) at the store. What is Picking Sequence? Picking Sequence is the ideal path to be followed in the store for a particular Pick List. Following the Picking Sequence (usually suggested by a WMS) will help reduce unwanted movements (Muda), improve productivity and reduce congestion within the store. What is ASRS? ASRS or Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems are PLC-controlled Material Handling Equipment designed to move material in a warehousestore based on triggers received from a linked Warehouse Control System (WCS). ASRS systems are used in warehouses that have a very high transaction volume and very less available space. What is Part Labelling? Part Labelling using AIDC technologies like Barcode or QR Code helps in identification and counting of parts quickly and accurately. Manual labelling of a part in human-readable text is more prone to errors compared to Auto-ID technology. What is Location Labelling? Location Numbering and Labelling helps in identification of individual locations in a store using an uniform terminology. Combined with a Location Management System, it helps in precisely identifying the location of the parts in a store. What is Tote Picking? Tote Picking involves picking multiple small parts in sequence. This helps to eliminate sub-optimal worker movement within the store. What are Gravity Chutes? Gravity Chutes are slides used for easy movement of parts within a multi-storey warehouse. Parts picked at higher levels (like from a mezzanine floor) can be moved to the dispatch bay through these chutes quickly and safely. What is Zone Picking? Zone Picking involves creating a pick list that routes the picker through the various zones within a store. The picker completes the picking task in each zone and moves to the next zone. This helps in reducing any zig-zag movement in a store. What is Wave Picking? In wave picking , multiple pickers can simultaneously perform picking across multiple zones and the materials are aggregated in the dispatch bay before shipment. Wave Picking can help improve TAT in cases where there are multiple orders to be fulfilled in a relatively short time period. What is Stock TakingCounting? Stock TakingCounting is a continuous method of stock reconciliation that can be done periodically such that a portion of the store gets audited every few days. With the advent of WMS systems , Stock TakingCounting Results can be tracked easily across multiple counts to identify high-risk parts that need extra care. What is RFID Tracking? RFID Tracking of inventory is an AIDC method to track inventory and capture relevant data automatically using activepassive RFID tags and RFID readers. Used in combination with other technologies, like GPS, RFID can be helpful in tracking inventory spread across multiple locations. What is Application",

Used in combination with other technologies, like GPS, RFID can be helpful in tracking inventory spread across multiple locations. What is Application Interfaces? Application Interfaces are connectors between two or more IT systems that facilitate electronic data transfer of information between these systems. Application Interfaces help in seamless flow of data across multiple systems and eliminate the need for duplicate data entry. What are Binning Rules? Binning Rules are pre-set business rules configured in WMS to optimize the location utilization and worker productivity in a store. This helps in reducing manual intervention and judgement while selecting the ideal storage location while receiving a part. What are Picking Rules? Picking Rules are pre-set business rules configured in WMS to ensure picking is done as per FIFO. Multiple business rules can be combined (e.g. FEFO FIFO) to improve inventory health. Picking Rules can also be defined to identify the optimal picking sequence and minimize Muda. What is Location Restriction? Location Restriction is a type of Binning Rule enforced in WMS applications to ensure that a part is stored in only certain areas of a store. For example, WMS can be configured to bin steel rodsplates in specific outdoor yards from where material issue could occur. What is Instruction-Confirmation Method of Material Movement? Instruction-Confirmation Method of Material Movement helps in keeping the physical stock in sync with the WMSERP stock and minimizes discrepancies. In this method of warehouse management, the Store Supervisor issues an instruction (e.g. Pick List) to the workers in the store to move Z units of a part from Location X to Location Y. On completion of the movement, the workers confirm to the supervisor that the movement is completenot carried out (E.g. Pick Confirmation). This information gets updated in the WMSERP. What is Cube-utilization of Storage Space? Cube-utilization of Storage Space is the total volume occupied by the parts in a bin. Utilization in warehouse management can be improved by matching the right part to the right bin type and by storing multiple parts together. What is a KPI Dashboard? KPI Dashboards are simple visualizations of complex data that help users in making informed decisions in warehouse management. KPI Dashboard can be configured based on the data accumulated in transactional applications like WMS. Further Reading httpspublication.sipmm.edu.sg httpswww.supplychainbrain.com",

    "text": "Why is data so important when it comes to warehouse or supply chain management? What role do data and information play in effective supply chain and warehouse management? The obvious answer is that the right data and information help in improving the organizations decision-making and performance, which naturally results in better profits for the company. Importance of warehouse data analysis Consider the key performance indicators (KPIs) we use for measuring the performance of a warehouse. KPIs depend on proper data. The more and better data we get, the better the chances of measuring and improving the performance of the business. Accumulated research from McKinsey Global Institute ( MGI ) and McKinsey Companys Business Technology Office shows that the amount of data collected and mined has become indispensible for organizations for making financial decisions. Data is helping companies outperform their competitors in the industry. Companies adopt data sensors such as barcodes to determine how their products are being used in the real world and what new service offerings or future products can be offered. It is not only the volume of information that makes difference to the company, but also the quality of information that is available. Real-time and high frequency nature of data gives a competitive advantage to a company over its peers. While the right data provides competitive advantage to an organization, the converse is also true. Wrong data can be equally detrimental to a company. How to collect warehouse data for analysis? We have already established the importance of data in decision making. The next question to ask is, how do we collect data? Data collection techniques can be classified as quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative methods rely on data sampling and structured data collection techniques. Techniques such as linear programming and time-series analysis that use mathematical models can be classified as quantitative data collection techniques. Unlike quantitative data collection techniques, qualitative data collection techniques are less structured and quite often, open ended. They rely more heavily on judgement and intuition than the mathematical model. Nonetheless, they too involve collecting extensive data. Some techniques include opinions of sales force, expert opinions, and Delphi method and consumer surveys. The type of data collected may vary across different segments of the supply chain. For example, if it is transportation, the position of goods in transit or number of packs in movement is an important data that needs to be collected. In a warehouse, position of the productSKU within the warehouse or the quantity of the products available on hand at any point of time is important data to be collected. Advantages of warehouse data analysis As you may have witnessed above, there are several benefits of data collection and analysis that are self-evident. Warehouse data analysis can help organizations make important decisions through Identifying certain important and mission-critical trends. Providing better awareness regarding potential customer habits. Helping organizations in identifying performance problems that require action. Apart from these benefits, certain data collection techniques help you avoid any wild guessing, in turn helping avoid wrong decisions. Data can also be extrapolated to obtain new insights and probable future trends. Some data analysis techniques are Pareto analysis and What-If analysis . The Pareto-analysis is a statistical technique that helps in taking decisions. This is done by selecting a few tasks that can affect the outcome in a significant way. It uses the Paretos principle (80-20 rule). This technique is particularly useful where multiple possible courses of action are competing for attention. In a nutshell, the problem-solver estimates the benefit of each action and selects a number of most effective actions which can",

This technique is particularly useful where multiple possible courses of action are competing for attention. In a nutshell, the problem-solver estimates the benefit of each action and selects a number of most effective actions which can deliver a total benefit close to a maximal possible one. What-if analysis, also called the sensitivity analysis, is a brainstorming technique that determines how small changes in the assumptions can affect the projected performance that is based on these assumptions. This type of analysis is used to compare various scenarios and possible outcomes based on changing conditions. Here is an example of how data analysis can help a warehouse perform better. PALMS Analytics provides you in-depth information about warehouse space utilization in terms of either product volume or product weight. This includes providing data about how much space has been utilized as well as the inefficient usage of the available location capacity either in terms of weight or volume. The data received can help in planning efficient space utilization. PALMS Analytics also helps in mapping a location in the warehouse as well as providing information regarding order fulfilment. How Palms Analytics helps increase supply chain reliability PALMS Analytics is powered by QlikView, the fastest growing BI product in the world. Clear visibility of KPI through powerful, interactive Business Intelligence Analytics dashboards is the significance of this version. PALMS Analytics phenomenally improves a warehouses analytical capability by offering a performance management platform that truly helps you control costs, maximize profitability and boost your business results.

    "text": "Supply chain systems today have become powerful with the advent and increase in the use of the internet. Back in the 80, the systems data usage and analytics were restricted and disparate. Systems were in silos and not connected to each other. For example, the manufacturer, supplier, and retailerend customer data was restricted to its network. Today the data available for analysis at the manufacturers end can benefit the supplier or the customer or vice versa. Such data can be shared using standard communication formats using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Web Services, partner portals, and the like. Extended supply chains have become critical success factors in various industry sectors. Let us examine a few sectors to get an idea of how business scenarios and challenges can be addressed by an all-encompassing supply chain setup. Retail Industry Large retailers today, share sales data, by location, with their suppliers resulting in competition amongst the suppliers to offer better prices, quality, and timely delivery of goods to the retailer, which ultimately benefits the end customer. Large distribution centers extend their system to their stockists for them to get a visibility of inventory availability and place orders real time. Stock allocation happens accurately resulting in timely supply of goods to the stockists. The stockists also have visibility of quantity and expected receipts. Extending the stock allocation functionality to the stockist helps the distributor define his saleable and non-saleable inventory clearly. Vendor managed inventory is fast gaining pace in large retail environments. Under this concept the supplier inventory is physically located at a Retail outlet on consignment basis until it is sold to the end customer. Such complex supplier-vendor relations require extending supply chain systems which talk to each other. Automotive Industry Automotive companies share quality check information with suppliers resulting in improvement in the manufacturing or assembly process at the suppliers end. This results in reduced defective parts per million sent by the supplier, ultimately resulting in fewer car recalls. Automotive companies and large ancillary parts manufacturers also extend their order management system to their suppliers, so that parts are received pre-barcoded and indented quantities are always accurate. Such systems help suppliers meet the agreed time lines. Reconciliation is fast and accurate at both ends, eliminating ambiguity. Manufacturing Nowadays customers are not limited by geography. Large manufacturers engage 3PL providers for storing and handling delivery of goods and materials. Some of these deliveries are JIT and have stringent delivery SLAs to be adhered to with huge fines for stock outs. Extending supply chain systems to 3PL operators to have real time information on orders received and good delivered helps manufacturers adhere to their SLAs for JIT goods supply. Extended supply chain system also helps in cross docking for re-distribution or consolidation of inventory in a particular zone or geography. Pharmaceuticals Pharmaceutical companies set aside huge spends on brand creation. However non-availability of the brand or a stock out results in lower market share. Studies have shown that large pharmaceutical companies lose out market share to local players when they cannot supply drugs on time. Companies have to make strategic and tactical decisions in the markets they operate in to ensure their success. Visibility of critical information about their sales numbers not just at the primary and secondary levels but the tertiary or end consumer sale level is required. They need to extend their supply chain all the way to the retailer. The flip side of the coin is that this same data has to be used to improve processes and ensure availability of their brands at the retailer all the time, while not having",

    "text": "In our other blogs , we have detailed the various types of picking methodologies available for a warehouse manager to choose from, such as batch picking, zone picking, consignmentorder-based picking, and wave picking. Amongst these, the subject of wave picking is vast enough that it requires its own article. What is Wave Picking? Wave picking is a scheduled order-picking process, executed in a short duration, multiple times in a day, in which multiple customer orders having disparate SKUs are picked up by multiple pickers at the same time. A typical wave would be scheduled to last, depending on the size of the warehouse and type of SKU, between 30 and 60 mins. How does wave picking work? Wave Picking as mentioned earlier is a scheduled short duration picking operation. Let us consider a scenario where a Wave is scheduled every 1 hour. Apart from the wave schedule the following parameters need to be defined Shifts day 1 Operation Time 0900 to 1700 Break Time 1300 to 1400 Wave First Run Time 0800 a.m. Considering the above parameters the first Wave will get generated for 0800 a.m. for 0900 a.m. picking, the second wave will get generated at 0900 a.m. for 10 a.m. picking, so on and so forth. In each wave, all orders are consolidated and based on preconfigured parameters, multiple picking instructions are generated. The generated picking instruction for a picker will include similar types of SKUs for different orders form the same location. This ensures that the picking operator does not have to unnecessarily travel across the warehouse to pick up SKUs. All picking operators drop the SKUs to a centralised Sorting Location. The sorting operator then proceeds to sort the SKUs according to their order numbers. Once the sorting operations are completed, the SKUs are sent for packaging and after packing to the dispatch bay, from where the material is shipped to the customer. What is the wave picking procedure? To implement wave picking a few fundamental questions have to be answered How to select orders How to assign picks How to give sorting instructions How to group dispatches Let us see how this can be achieved How are orders selected? Order selection is the first and an extremely important step in Wave Picking process. While selecting which orders to process in the wave, some of the criteria that should be considered are Order Type Order Age Transportation Lead Time Distance from Warehouse to Customer Location Truck Dispatch Time Courier Pickup Time The above criterion ensures that no order is left unfulfilled. Apart from the above mentioned criterion, the other important criterion is to configure the picking cut off time. Picking cut off time specifies, the cut off time for SKUs to be shipped at a particular point of time. For example, consider that a truck courier is scheduled to leave for Bangalore at 1400. Picking cut off time will specify the maximum time till orders can be picked for the 1400 dispatch. The points to be considered for specifying the cut off time are Picking Lead Time Sorting Lead Time Packing Lead Time and Loading Lead Time This approach also ensures that in case truck capacity is not fulfilled the maximum SKUs for Bangalore route would be picked up as the cut off time draws closer. How are picks assigned? Once the orders are selected, the orders need to be assigned to picking operators. This is an important process because if picks are not assigned properly it may result in delayed or incorrect picks. The most important points to be considered while assigning picks are Picking",

How are picks assigned? Once the orders are selected, the orders need to be assigned to picking operators. This is an important process because if picks are not assigned properly it may result in delayed or incorrect picks. The most important points to be considered while assigning picks are Picking Capacity per Person Traversal time from i) Sorting Area to Aisle ii) Average Picking Time for a SKU at that location iii) Traversal time from one end of the aisle to the other end of the aisle iv) Aisle to Aisle traversal time Total picking time available MHE dependent location Number of Pickers available There are three options to arrive at number of pickers available, they are Integrate with Attendance Management System to identify number of pickers available Assume infinite set of pickers Define number of pickers available and assume all the pickers are present The best option would be to integrate with Attendance Management System of the client. This will ensure that the picks assigned are realistic and will not overburden the picker. In the other two options as the actual number of pickers are not known, efficiency of the wave can get compromised and impact subsequent waves. When the picking operator picks a SKU from a location, a picking label should be attached to the SKU. The picking label will have all the relevant details of the order as well as information required for sorting and packing. How are the sorting instructions given? As wave picking involves picking SKUs for different orders at the same time, items have to be sorted according to the order numbers. Sorting instructions can be given in two ways Sort to Light Instruction based sorting Sort to Light In this methodology, when the sorting operator scans the picking label barcode, a sorting location lights up, giving the operator a visual instruction. The disadvantage in this method is that only one sorting operator can carry out the sorting operation at any given point of time. Instruction Based Sorting In this methodology, when the sorting operator scans the picking label, the sorting location is displayed on the HHT device used by the operator. In instruction based sorting method, we can assign multiple sorting operators to a location, thereby increasing the sorting efficiency. How are the groups dispatched? After sorting operation is completed, the SKUs will be packed and placed in the dispatch bay. To ensure that all the picked material is dispatched on time while taking care of truck efficiency is very important. If truck efficiency is not maintained it will directly add to the operations cost of the company. Grouping of dispatches and truck loading should ideally be carried out based on the route travelled by the truck and the number of delivery hubs located in that particular route. That is to say, if the origin point of the truck is Mumbai and its destination is Bangalore, then the truck should ideally contain material for all the hubs falling in that particular route. This is similar to the milk run concept. This approach ensures that the truck always meets its efficiency threshold. Should your business implement wave picking? Wave picking is an interesting concept but is best suited for situations where huge numbers of disparate SKUs are being ordered every hour, similar to the",

    "text": "Why Warehouse Management System? It is not so easy to manage warehouse operations. It includes efficient utilization of man-power, equipment space and at the same time reduce the inventory carrying cost all of which helps to run a profitable business in todays competitive business environment. It looks simple in theory. But in reality, the warehouse operation is vast and requires the right mix of people, procedures, systems, and solutions to run uninterrupted operations. Many companies adopted WMS which helps them to manage their warehouse operations, they control inward, outward movements and storage of materials and then processing the related transactions. Today WMS has evolved over the years, the number of functionalities that these systems can handle has increased exponentially. Functionalities like Location Management, Auto put-away, Wave and batch picking, Task Management, Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC), Sales Order, Purchase Order, Advanced Shipment Notifications (ASN), Cross Docking, Kitting, Stock Transfer and Movements, Stock Taking Cycle Count and slotting are just a few of the fundamental warehouse functions that todays WMS can handle. I have seen increased features and functionalities within the base of standard WMS solutions. There are so many features that come standard and many more that companies can pick and use as they need them. The new generation WMS functionality like Business Analytic, KPI, Labor Management, eKanban, Jumbiki, Muda Reduction, Forecasting and inventory optimization, Inventory Visibility, SOBO (Sell One Buy One), JIT (Just In Time), RFID, Smart Phone Mobile Computing are in high demand as companies struggle to work smarter, better, and faster in todays competitive business environment. Future ready systems like PALMS WMS is a good example of a solution that allows companies to buy licenses on On Premises or On Cloud basis and go live with a minimal amount of work time. Few years ago that would not have been possible due to the need for changes and modifications required for different industries in one single system. You can read more about the specific benefits of WMS here . The fact that many companies dont use their WMS to their fullest capacities contributes to the ROI challenge or the WMS does not have functionalities to support their requirements or they do not have adequate environment, facilities and staff to handle system and procedures. They get the systems implemented and say, now what? Then, they feel like they didnt get what they hoped to gain from their investments. Rarely vendors are visiting the companies and helping them use their WMS to their fullest potential. However over the last few years many industries adopted WMS and played important roles in WMS advancement. Industries like FMCG, automotive, apparels, electronics and online market place showed more interest in buying future ready or upgrading existing warehouse management systems. As WMS vendors like Technoforte Software work to resolve these issues, and as industry increasingly turns to technology to create inefficiencies within their operations, the warehouse management market will hold its ground as one of the favorite of the supply chain software sector.

    "text": "Supply chain management is crucial in order to achieve the targets set by the recent National Food Security Bill. The National Food Security Bill 2013 which was passed by way of an ordinance in the parliament is no small feat undertaken by the Government of India. This bill promises subsidized food grains to nearly 68 of Indias 1.2 Billion population at a cost of nearly USD 4 Billion! The bill aims to provide quality food grains and nutritional security, to underprivileged children, women, and poorer sections of society, at affordable prices. Indeed a very noble and ambitious plan. While the bill may face regulatory challenges, the real challenges that will affect the effectiveness of the initiative lie elsewhere. A lot of infrastructure, storage, and distribution issues will have to be addressed on a war footing by the government. Some of the specific logistics problems the government will have to deal with are Procurement of food grains Fair price purchase from farmers Storage Quality Assurance Distribution Network Pilferage and Leakages Accurate forecasting of Demand and Supply Managing the Supply Chain The government will also have to deal with another set of problems such as Minimum Support Price (MSP) of food grains, poverty categorization of citizens, alterations to be brought in the existing Public Distribution System (PDS), irregularities, corruption, grievances redress, and vigilance committees. However, in this article we shall specifically look into logistic issues highlighted above and throw some light on what the government should do to address these on priority. Freight Infrastructure and Connectivity New multi-modal hubs connected by roads, rails and waterways will have to be developed for timely supply of food grains from excess producing regions, to far flung consuming regions, in rural and urban India. Dedicated rail lines and fast track highway roads will need to be assigned for this purpose so that food grains reach on time and in good condition. Dedicated rail lines and waterways will in fact help the government in reducing logistics cost, a policy followed by leading nations of the world like USA and China. This will ensure seamless flow of food grains from hubs to warehouses to trucks to spokes to PDS shops to the ultimate consumers, the Below Poverty Line (BPL) population. The government will have to look at a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model and invite private investors to add momentum to this pressing need and also ensure this proposal makes business sense to the private investors. Wooing investment into freight infrastructure sector with attractive returns will be a win-win situation for both, India and the Investors. Construction of Scientific Warehousing and Logistics Parks Modern scientific warehouses and multi-modal Logistic parks will have to be developed by the government for this purpose. These Warehouses and Logistic Parks will need to be connected by Rail, Road, Waterways and Air. Lot of planning and design will need to be done, keeping in mind the future storage and connectivity requirement. Green warehouses will need to be built which will consume very little electricity for internal lighting and air circulation. Existing facilities up-gradation will need to be undertaken to get more out of the existing setup. Optimal space utilization, movement of units within the warehouses and parks, parking and dispatch bays setup, super flat flooring for vertical space utilization, assigning space for different warehouse activities, warehouse safety etc. will require intrinsic planning. Processes such as fumigation and audit will need to be clearly defined to ensure food grains stay for longer and quality is maintained across warehouses. The government is doing many things for this sector but more than double the current logistics",

Processes such as fumigation and audit will need to be clearly defined to ensure food grains stay for longer and quality is maintained across warehouses. The government is doing many things for this sector but more than double the current logistics budget needs to be channelized for logistics infrastructure development to meet the growing demand in the coming decade. Even this may not suffice. You can read more about major agenda points for supply chain management here . Intelligent Supply Chain Management software systems Intelligent Supply Chain management software applications, which to have the ability to communicate with each another, will be the key for successful implementation of the proposed National Food Security Bill 2013. All other infrastructure projects and processes can be successfully executed and monitored with the help of right information technology infrastructure. A robust and scalable software system will aid the government in taking key decisions such as Manage payments for purchase based on the negotiable warehouse receipt or similar instruments Fix Minimum Support Price for purchase of food grains from farmers Forecast Demand and Supply Fix selling price of food grains based on production and stock data information Manage subsidy allocations received from the center Storage Planning and optimization Dispatch Planning and execution to get timely last mile reach Conduct regular quality audit A National Integrated Logistics policy will certainly need to have precedence if National Food Security Bill 2013 is to be successfully executed and sustained. How would PALMS Intelligent Supply Chain Management System fit into the overall logistics strategy? PALMS Warehouse Management System has been successfully implemented at large companies and institutes for managing inventory lying across multiple locations over a web browser. A government institute can attain great value from implementing such robust and extensible system. A robust supply chain solution can help address the key concerns of inventory availability, optimization, and time to dispatch. Correct prediction can be done using the PALMS forecasting module so that procurement and dispatch are more data driven based on previous trends, stock in hand, food grains ordered, seasonality and future demand expected. One of the industry niches PALMS has had great success with is cold storage management . Such a system can help the government maintain optimal inventory levels, take critical decision like when to import or export food grains, drastically reduce pilferage and set a process which reduces manual vigilance to a great extent. You can read in greater detail about the challenges in supply chain systems and the importance of supply chain analytics on our blog. In conclusion, infrastructure and systems need to be in place rapidly along with production plans, to make the food security bill affordable and effective. With wastage of 50 of the production on one hand and a big undernourished populace on the other hand, the food security bill can easily become an albatross around the neck without remedial measures in place. The weakest link needs to be addressed now, before our taxpayers money rots somewhere. Article by Sanjay Kikla, Director (Sales), Technoforte Software Pvt. Ltd.

    "text": "Third-party logistics (3PL) providers are establishments that provide solutions to help various businesses manage and execute the logistics of warehousing in a better manner. 3PL service providers can boost warehouses success rates and simplify their customers supply chains. They also help in bringing effectiveness in order fulfillment and shipping transport. In a nutshell, a 3PL (third-party logistics) provider offers outsourced logistics services. In essence, 3PL companies monitor and manage warehousing operations, the transportation of goods, and order fulfillment. WMS Technology in 3PL Implementing a comprehensive warehouse management system enables a 3PL company with organized data on warehouse stock and an easy way to keep track of goods belonging to multiple clients. WMS technology can improve slotting and picking patterns and increase communication between transportation management and warehouse management systems. Advanced WMS systems can also communicate with labor management software, which helps companies optimize their workforce. 3PL operators today also are extending services beyond basic warehousing provide consulting and advise the retailer or manufacturer on the best course of action. Improved Warehousing Experience Warehousing is the crucial link in the entire supply chain and leads to perfect order fulfilment if designed and managed professionally. Several tasks such as receiving, storage, cross docking shipping activities are performed under a warehouse. When operating a warehouse, businesses always come across questions about storage structure, inventory management, resource planning and so on. Appropriate solutions to these concern areas make any warehousing operation efficient, which in-turn leads to organized processes and subsequently enhance productivity. Seasoned 3PL service providers know their warehousing network in and out and are fully capable of fulfilling warehousing needs for any kind of product and type of operation. Warehouses managed by 3PL providers are the perfect storage and distribution choice irrespective of whether your products need racking or surface storage, palletized or non-palletized, etc. A Perfectly Designed Warehouse In the entire supply chain cycle financial investments in warehousing is one of the largest by any business. Unaligned warehouses for the strategy planned, leads to inefficient order fulfilment rate. Corporates should ideally understand that alignment with 3PL providers will bring down their warehousing cost and they can use a perfectly built warehouse with all the latest facilities to store their inventories at a cost effective monthly rental model. Well Defined Storage Process 3PL providers provide customized services from heavy shelving to light racking, pallet storage to piece storage and using best storage method to store the product. Every product is unique and needs to be stored properly for efficient picking and order fulfillment. This is the basic rule of warehousing to store heavy, light, fragile, perishable and temperature controlled cargo separately along with utilization of maximum warehouse space. Storage methods should be in a way to make your warehouse operations most efficient and save storage cost, picking time and reduce the possibility of wrong shipping. Process Importance Warehouse is considered as the storage and distribution hub of any business. Right from setting up to running daily operations, warehousing brings multiple challenges to the business should be error free. Along with challenges, it is absolutely not feasible for individual businesses to own and operate warehouses on their own. Process adherence for operating a warehouse makes it more efficient. Inbound and outbound processes should be well defined and implemented. A process-less operation always lead to unfulfilled orders, missed TAT, mismatched inventory levels leading to less warehouse efficiency. Outsourcing warehouse operations to an expert 3PL partner resolves all your operational challenges. 3PL service providers always make sure they follow a standard operation procedure considering the customers supply chain strategies and ensure required throughput is achieved consistently.",

Outsourcing warehouse operations to an expert 3PL partner resolves all your operational challenges. 3PL service providers always make sure they follow a standard operation procedure considering the customers supply chain strategies and ensure required throughput is achieved consistently. Embrace 3PL It is a fact that partnering with 3PL service providers can always fuel warehouses success factors and bring drastic simplification in your entire supply chain. But then there are always some flip side to the same and problems may arise. An important disadvantage is that direct control over the processes in warehouse management cannot be held. This lack of control can sometimes lead to customers having to settle for little to no clue on the way that a warehouse is run. But with technology based tools that are available today, its easier for 3PL companies to provide end to end visibility to shippers that use their services. Hence it is very key that 3PL management companies implement modern technology which shall then surely lead to a rise in their adoption. IT enablement By 3PL, for 3PL In recent studies it has been established that around 86 percent of Fortune 500 companies and 96 percent of the Fortune 100 use 3PL services. Witnessing a paramount growth in the usage of 3PL warehouse and inventory management software, 3PL companies are slowly starting to embrace the best IT solutions some are even developing their own solutions. One substantial help to this is that 3PL companies are well aware whats the key to be a leader in the market. 3PL companies are gearing up and developing software which offers many other key benefits. This definitely brings in advantage such as reduction of downtime when integrating the new solutions. With in-built software developed specifically for the use of 3PL companies, we can expect is drastic reduction in downtime during the implementation of new software. Conclusion 3PL operators shall continue to establish their presence for a long time and will provide a series of benefits for customers that integrate their services. An effective optimum usage of time and resources coupled with efficiency and customer delight are vital in ensuring a healthy supply chain management. With the rise in trend of shipping and warehousing demands there is no doubt on the significance growth for 3PL centric warehousing, inventory and transportation management solutions. It would be prudent for businesses to adopt a 3PL focused WMS technology solution with the current advancements in the domain.

    "text": "Cross-dock operations are one of the most crucial concepts in supply chain management, which reduces the supply chains overall cost while increasing the supply chains efficiency. It is typically useful in a scenario where a large quantity of material has to be shipped regularly to a customermanufacturer from multiple suppliers. What is a Cross-Dock? A cross-dock is a regional warehouse that caters to suppliers from a particular region. The supplier, instead of sending the material directly to the customer, sends it to the cross-dock facility which in turn consolidates all items for the customer from multiple suppliers and dispatches the material on a periodic basis. The milk run concept forms the basis for it. Typically, they store material on a temporary basis and move out the stock as soon as possible. Types of Cross-Dock Based on operational requirements, they can be classified into Manufacturer Cross-Dock This is a dedicated facility and is operated by on behalf of a Manufacturer. Material from different suppliers is consolidated to reach optimumfull truckload (FTL) and shipped to the manufacturer. Distributor Cross-Dock A distributor cross dock is a FG facility where material from multiple suppliers are consolidated and shipped to a customer Transport Logistic Cross-Docking In this type, cargo of different carrierslogistic providers are consolidated in one truck and shipped. This is to ensure each shipment meets optimal truckload. How does a Cross Dock Work? Consider a scenario where a customer manufacturer has a facility in Bangalore. The said customer has a large number of suppliers from say Delhi and Haryana in the north, Kolkata in the east, Gujarat and Maharashtra from the west and Chennai and Bangalore from the south of India. The following methodologies can be used for dispatching material Direct Dispatch Cross dock In direct receiving, all suppliers irrespective of their location and distance from the customer will have to ship the materials individually. Suppliers who supply in large volumes will not be affected much by direct shipping, although they will have to take care of logistics. Suppliers who do not have volumes will find direct shipment to be a very costly affair, and end up with less than truckload (LTL). From the customers perspective logisticsmaterial tracking will be a nightmare. The customer will have absolutely no idea about the status of shipment, what material has been shipped in what quantity and ETA. In addition, tracking multiple suppliers, having each supplier ship material directly will add a lot of overhead on the customer in terms of cost and labor. In addition, shortage, excess and incorrect document verification becomes a tedious job affecting the overall efficiency of the organization. Receiving All suppliers associated with the process will send material at a predefined time. The operation starts from the point of dispatching a truck to collect material from the suppliers. Number of trucks can vary based on the number of suppliers associated, as well as the quantity to be collected. The truck leaves at predefined intervals, goes to each supplier and picks up the material. Suppliers can also directly send their material to the cross-dock facility. At the facility, the material is unloaded, received and binned. Based on predefined schedules, the material is loaded onto a truck with higher capacity and dispatched to the customer. The customer has to track only a finite set of trucks. The customer will also know of any shortages and excess shipments and can correct the same at the facility itself, reducing the load and inaccuracies at the time of GRN. Advantages of Cross-Dock Operations When there is a large number of suppliers concentrated in a particular area, it",

    "text": "Supply chain capabilities are typically considered the most crucial catalyst for improving efficiency and performance and may therefore be justifiably called the prime mover of growth. This is a much-neglected sector in India, and the new government may well start by bringing in reforms and introducing new impactful projects in the supply chain space. The Top three agenda points for the new government from this perspective are presented below GST The Goods Services Tax is a long pending reform awaited by the industry. Though a part of the election manifestoes of both the major political parties of India (viz. Congress BJP), the GST implementation has always been mired in conflict and controversies. The manner of GST implementation is also a subject of much acrimony and debate. GST would work best as a single uniform tax across the entire country. So far, India seems to have opted for the Dual GST Model, and critics of the same argue that CGST and SGST would be nothing but new fanciful names for what already goes by the name of CST and VAT. From the industrys perspective a single window for tax, a uniform tax structure across the entire country, and the Central Governments internal mechanisms to route the fair share of collected taxes to respective states would work best. Given the federal nature of our political system, this would require a consensus amongst the various State Governments (of various political hues) and the Central Government. No wonder then that GST hasnt still seen light of the day! In the absence of a uniform tax structure across the country, the supply chain is designed sub-optimally. The supply chain is fashioned in a way to create a minimum tax burden. This has largely prevented us from achieving economies of scale in warehousing and thereby optimizing the distribution costs. Personally for me, this would be one of the single biggest tests for the new Government. . If this happens, we can already hear our economy sputtering back to life. Warehouse Storage Facility Modernization The Warehousing Infrastructure in the country is split across government run, small scale private depots and professionally run enterprise warehouses. Of these, the largest lot is that of the government run and small scale private depots. See the overall distribution table below 1.Food Corporation of India (FCI),32.05 2. Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC),10.07 3.State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs),21.29 4. State Civil Supplies,11.3 5. Cooperative Sector,15.07 6. Private Sector,18.97 Barring the few professionally run enterprise warehouses, a majority of the above need massive overhauling of their infrastructure. Warehouses in India are typically characterized by dilapidated sheds, poor illumination, unhygienic unsafe work environment, lack of sanitary washrooms, minimal access to modern Material Handling Equipment (MHEs) like Forklifts, Trolleys, Stackers, etc. Not surprisingly then, warehouse management is a highly unattractive career choice for industry professionals. Scientific management of inventory therefore remains a far cry leading to a colossal waste countrywide. The situation is further compounded by the fact that we have an acute shortage of covered storage in the country. It is estimated that another 35 Million MTs additional warehousing capacity needs to be created in the country in the next 5 10 years. Private partnership though solicited by government, has met with mixed response so far primarily government tariffs are not seen as viable by major players. Under the stewardship of Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, the last NDA government had undertaken a massive project of creating the next generation highway network. The Golden Quadrilateral has unimaginably transformed the logistics landscape of the country. A similar exercise in upgrading the countrys Warehouse infrastructure is a most pressing need",

Under the stewardship of Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, the last NDA government had undertaken a massive project of creating the next generation highway network. The Golden Quadrilateral has unimaginably transformed the logistics landscape of the country. A similar exercise in upgrading the countrys Warehouse infrastructure is a most pressing need now. Faced with runaway price rise, modern warehousing is actually the silver bullet to solving the inflation conundrum. Timetable for Dematerialization of NWRs Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) were introduced in India in October 2010 as a primary means of commodity trade as well as to facilitate loans against the same through banks. Presently NWRs can be either paper based receipts or electronic receipts. Paper receipts are obviously fraught with many risks. Lack of transparency and visibility, burgeoning paperwork, time lag in reflecting transactions across systems etc., leave a number of loopholes in the system. The recent failure of NSEL is a case in point. Gullible investors under the assumption of NWRs being backed by adequate inventory in authorized warehouses found to their disadvantage that much of such inventories were actually fictitious. Failures such as these are systemic in nature and as such tend to destroy the overall investor confidence. While introduction of NWRs is itself a major reformist measure, it must be backed by proper systems to manage the scale of operations associated with it. Paper Receipts must be on their way out. Warehouses authorized to issue NWRs, must have a clear outer date by which they need to migrate to computerized Warehouse Management System with electronic NWRs being interfaced with Commodity Exchange Systems. Audit mechanisms can be sufficiently strengthened with the access to accurate data, further reducing the risk of malpractices. Sceptics may argue that many of these warehouses are in far flung remote areas with poor access to Network Systems, but the remoteness of such stock makes it all the more compelling to ensure such a monitoring system exists. The public sector banks have embraced computerization quite successfully across the entire rural landscape of the country. There is no reason why the warehousing industry cannot. The country cannot afford another failure on the lines of NSEL. These are some of the issues of paramount importance from the point of view of the supply chain industry. The gains to be made in both the short and the long term are enormous and can transform the way business is generally done in India. Implementing these proposed changes will not only improve the sentiments of We, The People, but will also have a cascading effect on how the outside world perceives the Indian Economy.

    "text": "Warehousing KPIs, or Key performance indicators, play a key role in helping an organization define and measure its progress toward the defined goals. Once the mission has been analyzed and the goals have been defined, KPIs are put in place for measuring the organizations progress. KPIs are measurements that can be quantified and agreed to beforehand. KPIs vary across different organizations and industries and stay for a long time without changing often. They reflect the organizations goals and are critical to its success. Importance of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Once the organizations goals are set, there should be some way to assess the organizations performance so that its progress toward the defined goals can be measured. Performance cannot be improved unless it can be measured. Benchmarking using KPIs helps identify your performance compared to your previous performance as well as against your peers. Warehousing is a dynamic business that requires close monitoring. A warehouse generates a huge amount of data that can be productively utilized. In todays world, warehousing is a highly competitive business with demanding customers. Most times, the customers define KPIs as part of a service agreement. Choosing the criteria for defining the KPIs is an important process. Different industriesbusiness models require different measurements. For example, KPIs for a 2PL warehouse will be different from that of a 3PL warehouse Similarly, an FG warehouses KPIs will be quite different from that of an RM warehouse. Hence, before defining a KPI, relevant parameters need to be measured for a specific warehouse. It is good to identify the various key processes in a warehouse and attach a KPI to the specific process. KPIs must always align with business requirements. Top KPIs The Supply Chain Operational Reference (SCOR) model, a product of the Supply Chain Council, provides a framework that links business processes, best practices, metrics, and technology features in a unified structure. SCOR identifies over 200 KPIs to monitor the overall performance of the supply chain. These form the top level or the Level 1 performance metrics. It also defines focused metrics to help specific processes improve. These form the level 2 and 3 metrics. Following are some of the top-level performance attributes and the associated metrics. Most of these performance metrics can also be applied to measure the performance of a warehouse process. Attribute Top Level Metric Supply Chain Reliability Delivery Performance Fill Rates Perfect Order Fulfilment Supply Chain Responsiveness Order Fulfilment Lead Times Supply Chain Flexibility Supply Chain Response Time Production Flexibility Supply Chain Costs Cost of Goods Sold Total Supply Chain Management Costs Value-Added Productivity WarrantyReturns Processing Costs Supply Chain Asset Management Efficiency Cash-to-Cash Cycle Time Inventory Days of Supply Asset Turn Note The links provided belong to a third party.

Warehousing KPIs to Analyze Business Performance The business performance of an organization is normally measured by the revenues and profits it makes and the various costs it has incurred. As such, some of the KPIs for business performance may be Profits Gross Profit (Revenue Cost of Goods Sold) Net profit (Gross Profit Operating Expenses Taxes and Interest) TurnoverRevenue Costs (various costs such as inventory, labor, machinery, etc.) Warehousing KPIs to Analyze Operational Efficiency The efficiency with which a warehouse operates is decided by how well various factors such as people, machinery, inventory, skill sets, and processes are managed. Some of the KPIs for measuring warehouse operational efficiency may be Utilization (space, labor, equipment, etc.) Wastage (wastage of inventory due to expiry or other reasons, man hours, skills, etc.) Fulfilment (timely order fulfillment, percentage of",

They are usually assessed in terms of safety measures taken to prevent theft, machinery-related accidents, human safety, accidental fire, etc. Some KPIs for measuring these issues can be Accidents related Lost time (in hours) due to accidents (including fatalities) (no. of hours worked) (No. of fatalities)(no. of hours worked) Health-related Health and safety prevention costs within the month Percentage of productsservices assessed for health and safety impacts Warehousing KPIs to measure Eco-friendliness This is another area that has taken priority equal to that of business performance and operational efficiency. In most countries, organizations are bound legally and are held responsible for corporate social responsibility. Some KPIs in this area may be Emissions (CO2 tonnesemployeemonth) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissionsemployeemonth Renewable energy usage Percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials Total on-site created energy BI Dashboards to visually track KPIs in real time PALMS Analytics is powered by QlikView, the fastest-growing Business Intelligence (BI) product in the world.
